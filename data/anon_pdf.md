**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **1949** — Scientist Albert Collins claims he worked on electromagnetic propulsion at Cal-Berkeley and analyzed samples that were taken away by the Army. The metal was thin, light and could not be dented or cut; it could fold and return to shape.

Collins claims in 1949, Rand Corporation and the CIA solicited assistance on sample analysis from a Vatican representative; he claims he saw project names **Archangel**, **Blue Book**, **Black Book**, **White Book** and **Yellow Book**, adding that he heard LANL was analyzing green fireballs (this last claim has been confirmed as **Project Twinkle**).

He claims he heard rumors of autopsies of “midget people” at Los Alamos, experiments at Holloman AFB and Kirtland AFB, metal-like wood tested in Berkley he was not involved with, and flying disc landings on military bases in California and New Mexico. Collins also states a friend told him Archangel determined UAP occupants were extraterrestrial, biological, gas-breathing intelligent animals with larger craniums than humans. He claims this friend told him the occupants had cells similar to plants that were responsive to sunlight and were able to make right or wrong judgements like humans.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **17 August 1949** — An alleged CIA OSI information report on the analysis of UAP states a special studies project within the DOD known as Unidentified Lenticular Aerodyne Technology Transfer (ULATT) Exploitation Program houses six undisclosed projects. It states a power plant was recovered from a crashed UAP in New Mexico and a meeting was held on 14 July 1949 at Blair House where President Harry S. Truman proposed that the “know how” of ULATT be shared with Canada and the UK. The document also alleges that Hannes Alfven, who would win the Nobel Prize in 1970 for his work on magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), was consulted during his early MHD work because it was suggested the ULATT technology used magnetic field lines for travel.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **1952** — Former Naval officer and consultant to Lockheed-Vega and Glenn L. Martin Co. Thomas Townsend Brown proposes **Project Winterhaven** to the US military.

Brown proposes using Stanford Research Institute (SRI), University of Chicago, The Franklin Institute, the Glenn L. Martin Co’s Research Institute for Advanced Studies (RIAS), Lear Inc., Jansky & Bailey, Brush Development Co., and Hancock Manufacturing Co. to create flying disc craft for the US military that can travel in excess of 1,800 mph in all levels of atmosphere. This is a peculiar hypothetical framework as it didn’t involve several major aerospace contractors and instead chose to subcontract to several entities outside of US aerospace. It is allegedly rejected.

Rees started the informal Los Alamos Astrophysical Association to study green fireballs which eventually became Twinkle. All members were scientists and engineers with AEC/USAF security clearances.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **24 April 1952** — A special study group within Air Force Intelligence assesses nine undersea UAP with the Office of Naval Intelligence. ONI received the reports from U.S. Navy submarines that encountered the undersea UAPs over an undisclosed timeframe prior to the report. The incidents have never been released by ONI, and FOIA requests into the USAF special study group, AFOIN-X(SG), have been denied.

The group is rumored to have included a Col. Kieling, USAF civil service intelligence specialist Dr. Stefan T. Possony as acting chief, and Lt. Col. F. Sterling as military chief and likely operated outside of **Project Blue Book** as a flexible study group to take on special ad hoc tasks. AFOIN-X(SG) findings were therefore not shared in open Congressional hearings or with the public.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **2 December 1952** — CIA OSI Chief Philip Grandin Strong meets with MIT Provost Julius A. Stratton and professor Max Millikan to discuss UAP sightings and a means of studying them through **Project Lincoln**. Lincoln was an already established air defense project at MIT for the USAF, specifically analyzing photographic reconnaissance and surveillance.

The December 1952 memo suggests Lincoln had an interest in flying saucer cases beginning in mid-1952, and CIA OSI sought “full backing” of the DCI for MIT to formally study UAP. Unfortunately, no further Lincoln UAP documentation exists, and Lincoln summary reports do not mention UAP despite Stratton’s interest. USAF Capt. Edward J. Ruppelt later writes that **Project Lincoln’s Beacon Hill Group** recommended he set up “sound detection apparatus” in areas of UAP activity, suggesting the MIT scientists were doing actual UAP work under contract.

>**_Note_**: Project Lincoln may just be one example how the CIA/USAF/AEC “exported” UAP study to universities and private nonprofits (like Battelle, mentioned in the 9 January 1953 entry). Such analysis that may have been done at MIT is not mentioned in any updates to Congress or the American people, and Stratton’s interest contradicts the findings of the Robertson Panel, **Blue Book**, and Condon Committee that UAPs do not warrant further study.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **9 December 1952** — USAF Col. Donald L. Bower forbids Capt. Edward J. Ruppelt from visiting CIA Office of Scientific Intelligence to share information on compelling UAP data. CIA held the “Robertson Panel” the next month without these key cases.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **1953** — An anonymous former Warrant Officer in the Army claims he saw crates at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in 1953 with recovered bodies of small humanoids, recovered from Arizona in the desert, and states he happened to be at the “right place at the right time when the crates arrived at night by DC-7.”

He states he saw the humanoids lying on a fabric to prevent freeze burn from dry ice underneath, with heads disproportionately larger than their bodies, with brown skin, no hair, and wearing tight fitting dark suits; one humanoid appeared to be female. He states he heard that the UAP was picked up by special tracking equipment on Mt. Palomar, CA before the crash.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **1953** — An anonymous radar technician at Fort Monmouth, NJ in 1953, “Mr. T,” states he was summoned to see a special film at the base theater; with no briefing, he was shown a film of a desert scene with a silver disc object embedded in the sand with a dome at the top, and the bottom was a hatch or a door; in the next scene the source claims he saw 10-15 military personnel in fatigues with no ID patches standing around the craft.

The next scene showed the interior of the craft, a panel with levers all colored in muted pastel and white; the next scene showed two dead bodies on tables inside a tent, small with large heads that looked “mongoloid” with small noses, mouths and shut eyes, each wore a tight suit pastel in color; when the film ended there was no credit and the officer in charge instructed the viewers to “think about the movie” and “don’t relate its contents to anyone.”

Two weeks later Mr. T was approached by an intelligence officer on the base and told to “forget the movie you saw, it was a hoax.” Mr. T states the film was shot by an inexperienced camera man with poor coloring and texture. A friend of the man who was also a radar specialist told him years later that he too saw the same film under similar conditions.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **1953** — A source “H.J.” says he was in the Army at Fort Polk, LA in 1953 when they saw an egg shaped UAP crash land into soft sandy soil. A special detachment and ambulance were detached.

The object had no windows or lights and had a fin at its equator that was rotating, medics carried a body away that was making strange noises; the occupants walked as if they had no knees and were 3 1/2-4 feet tall, large heads covered by a helmet and a metallic green uniform. He heard the survivors were sent to a hospital and all died, and he heard their cadavers were sent to a medical center near Washington, DC. H.J. says he was told not to discuss the incident and after he talked to Leonard Stringfield, his phone was disconnected.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **21 May 1953** — USAF project engineer on contract with the AEC for Operation Upshot-Knothole “Fritz Werner” (pseudonym) states he was placed on special assignment to investigate a crashed UAP near Kingman, AZ on 21 May 1953, in a signed affidavit. Werner states the object was constructed of an unfamiliar metal similar to aluminum, was oval, and had an entrance; inside, he was told there were swivel steps, a cabin, instruments and displays. Werner states it had one occupant, now dead, dark brown complexion, 4 feet tall, wearing a silvery metallic suit and a skull cap with no face covering or helmet.

Werner states his job was to determine from the angle of the impact how fast the vehicle was going at the time of impact; he states the vehicle had no landing gear but also had no dents or even scratches; afterwards he was told by a USAF Col. To write his report in longhand, not to type or reproduce it, and not to reveal what he saw; Werner states he was given a telephone number to call when the report was complete and it was handed off to an airman. Werner’s diary reviewed by Ray Fowler corroborated this showing he wrote he went on “special assignment” that day and “got picked up at Indian Springs AFB…for a job I can’t write or talk about.”

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **12 April 1954** — “KA” states he served in the USAF in 1954-55 at Roswell Air Force Base where he began helicopter training. On the evening of 12 April 1954, KA states he was ordered to report to the flight line as there was a crash in the desert; his crew was “Rescue 4.” The crash retrieval was 25-30 miles northwest over a lake where they saw a metallic saucer crashed edgewise into the sand with a dome in the center, and the outer rim was still spinning and the outer edge lights were still rotating in that direction. Several small bodies were scattered outside the craft, motionless and appeared dead; 4-4.5 feet tall with large heads, in tight fitting dark blue uniforms, no helmets.

KA states a ground crew in fatigues was already there and prevented them from getting closer, and began tagging the objects and the bodies. More dead bodies were inside a small hatchway in the crashed disc. The UAP occupants had tried to crawl out on their hands and knees. After KA returned to Roswell he was debriefed for three days in “living hell” in Building No. 5, and told by men dressed in civilian clothes wearing black ties identifying as “intelligence officers” not to speak about the incident, and reading KA a law that referred to fine, imprisonment with hard labor and general discharge if he told anyone about the incident.

KA states he heard the saucer was taken on base and put in Hangar 18, which was expanded over the next two weeks with refrigeration equipment and sophisticated computers. KA heard a rumor at that time another UAP crashed near Bandelier, NM on 24 April 1954. KA states he was sent back to Sampson AFB where his superior accused him of going AWOL and punished him, to which KA told his superior about the UAP crash and his superior did not believe him. KA had a nervous breakdown and was placed in hospital for three months. During the stay, he was injected with a needle where he felt drunk and taken to a room with 4-5 people where he was asked questions about the crash recovery in New Mexico.

On the day he was released from hospital, KA states he was taken to the base commander’s office and met a Col., who discharged him on 7 March 1955 because he told the Sgt. (superior) about the CR in the desert. KA states that in the years after he was discharged he began having nightmares and needed to talk about the experience, to which Leonard Stringfield listened and believed him.

KA tells Stringfield at the CR, a second chopper landed with four men wearing white pants and long white coats, to which KA tried to photograph them but he was told “don’t take a picture of me, just take what you were told to take.” KA states he saw a silver aluminum colored metallic box on the ground 3 feet long and 1 1/2 feet high with numbers printed on it, there were words too that were indistinguishable; he tried to photograph the box but was told by the ground crew to “get the hell away from that.” The ground crew wore green fatigues with no insignia or rank identity.

KA states later he was told by a stranger in a neighborhood drugstore that he should not talk about his part in the neighborhood drug store and he was called and warned of consequences following a phone call he made in January 1982.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **1955** — Physicist Louis Witten states he was recruited by George S. Trimble, VP for Aviation and Advanced Propulsion Systems at the Glenn L. Martin Company, into the Research Institute for Advanced Studies (RIAS). Witten states Trimble recruited him to develop anti-gravity, and in 2013, stated anti-gravity was “discovered” in this project. Witten suggests several ideas were tested including using an isotope of bismuth, but does not give details. The Glenn L. Martin Company evolved into Martin-Marietta and merged with Lockheed in 1995.

Witten states while at RIAS he got a contract from Areas A and C at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base to work on anti-gravity for aerospace applications. No record of this contract exists but Witten did publish several theoretical articles concerning general relativity while at RIAS, whose legacy program Lockheed eventually acquired. Witten joined the University of Cincinnati after RIAS and was a professor of physics 1968-1991.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **1955** — An environmental systems VP in Van Nuys claims as early as 1955 he worked in a UAP group at Douglas Aircraft in Santa Monica; he claims he worked there with “Wheaten” (now at Lockheed, in the submarine division), Ted Gordon, “Klemperer” and Dave Crook. The VP states they were asked by Douglas management to assess cases from **Project Blue Book** including films and photos that led them to conclude UAP used “multi-dimensional physics.” The group was asked to forget this conclusion. He claims the Douglas group found a site in the “Owen Valley” where thousands of UAP went in and out of solid ground.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **1 March 1955** — Documents provided by former Douglas Aircraft engineer William Tompkins suggest Douglas was studying “unconventional” propulsion systems based in part on collection of UAP materials in the open source. Tompkins claims that he worked in a secret Douglas think tank called Advanced Design, tasked with helping the US Navy develop a secret space fleet using antigravity technology.

Tompkins claims he was helped by “Nordic” UAP occupants, while the USAF and RAND Corporation were working together with “Reptilian” UAP occupants to create a competing secret space
fleet. Tompkins also claims before the end of WWII, Nazi Germany had aligned itself with “Reptilian” UAP occupants and a secret Navy project out of Naval Air Station San Diego attempted to learn about secret Nazi antigravity programs. Tompkins provides no evidence for these claims, but does provide evidence he worked at Douglas and Naval Air Station San Diego.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **5 May 1955** — USAF ATIC and contractor Battelle Memorial Institute publish “Special Report No. 14,” a comprehensive analysis of 3,200 UAP sightings. The report concludes that UAP are not aerial craft beyond human scientific knowledge because no “physical matter” had ever been recovered in any UAP sighting. This contradicts two declassified metallurgical analyses on shape memory alloys Battelle itself performed for Wright-Patterson AFB six years earlier, which weren’t declassified until 2010.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **20 November 1955** — New York Herald Tribune journalist Ansel E. Talbert
writes about an “incredible program” to solve the “secret of gravity” at top U.S. scientific laboratories and research centers. Anti-gravity is reportedly being studied at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University, the University of Indiana’s School of Advanced Mathematical Studies, the Purdue University Research Foundation, MIT, the Roger Babson Gravity Research Institute of New Boston, NH, and the Institute of Pure Physics (IPP) at the University of North Carolina.

Former UNC President Gordon Gray approved funding for IPP; Gray was formerly Secretary of the Army, Assistant Secretary of Defense and special assistant to the President of the United States (Truman, Eisenhower). Scientists in the project tell Talbert they expect to discover anti-gravity within years to a quarter of a century at most; corporate IPP partners include Glenn L. Martin Co., Convair, Bell Aircraft, the Sikorsky Division of United Aircraft, Lear Inc., Clarke Electronics, the Sperry Gyroscope Division of Sperry-Rand Corp., and General Dynamics Corp.

Among the IPP participants mentioned are: Bryce S. Dewitt of the Radiation Laboratories at University of California at Berkeley, Burkhard Heim of Goettingen University, Pascual Jordan of Hamburg University, Vaclav Hlavaty of the University of Indiana, and Stanley Deser and Richard Arnowitt of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study.

>**_Note_**: The article also mentions George S. Trimble’s RIAS (see 1955), and states it is financed by Glenn L. Martin Co. but isolated from the company’s aircraft building business and managed by Welcome Bender. It is suggested RIAS partnered with IPP.

>**_Note_**: Gordon Gray’s presence in IPP anti-gravity studies is noteworthy. Gray was the director of the Psychological Strategy Board, a committee formed by the Truman Administration to coordinate and plan psychological operations. The Board included representatives from DOD and DCI.

Gray’s name also appears on disputed “TS/MAJIC EYES ONLY” documentation, specifically an alleged briefing document of a Majestic-12 Group, a R&D intelligence operation allegedly established by Pres. Truman in 1947. Gray is listed as one of twelve members with access to the information, allegedly pertaining to UAP crash recoveries, study and analysis of the intent of UAP occupants.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **24 January 1956** — Wright-Patterson AFB monitored a reported “landing” of a flying saucer in the Kataghan province of Afghanistan. USAF attempted an overflight for aerial view, search and confirmation of info, and to determine if Afghanistan authorities were hauling the recovered craft to Kabul. Neither USAF ATIC nor Battelle amended their conclusion that a lack of physical evidence meant UAP were not advanced craft, and CIA OSI did not update their conclusions. Subsequent Congressional inquiries in the 1960s relied on conclusions that were out of date and continued to not include physical debris.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **25 February 1956** — The Special Weapons Study Unit of Aviation Studies International, Ltd. delivers an examination of electrogravitics systems (the link between electromagnetism and gravity to produce antigravity) to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. The report refers to a **Project Winterhaven** that suggested a “saucer” could create a local gravitational field and serve as a USAF interceptor with Mach 3 capability. It was declassified in 1995. Winterhaven was allegedly based on the designs of Thomas Townsend Brown.

It states Glenn Martin Co. (see 20 November 1955) could be achieved in six years but it would need a “Manhattan Project” environment to achieve it; Clarke Electronics, General Electric, Bell Labs, Convair, Lear Inc., Sperry-Rand, Curtiss-Wright, Lockheed, Boeing and North American are all mentioned as working on antigravity “rigs.”

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **April 1956** — USMC Maj. Darrell L. Ritter, ONR Capt. Sidney Sherby and ONR Projects Officer Cmdr. George W. Hoover receive an annotated copy of Morris K. Jessup’s The
Case for the UFO (1955), with annotations from three different persons who claim to know about UFO intelligences, deep space origin, underwater bases, force fields, and more. Sherby and Hoover reprint the annotated version with government contractor Varo Manufacturing and prints 25 copies.

ONR’s link to Jessup is curious because in this same year, Jessup claims to have been receiving letters from someone known as “Carlos Miguel Allende,” who claims that an 1943 experiment in the Philadelphia Navy Yard rendered a destroyer (the USS Eldridge or USS Engstrom) invisible and personnel on board showed side effects. The project is soon allegedly linked to the work of Thomas Townsend Brown, who earlier that year proposed a **Project Winterhaven** to the US military to use electrogravitics for aerospace purposes.

The “Philadelphia experiment,” as it becomes known, allegedly utilized electrogravitics for naval stealth purposes. It is unknown what the extent of the experiment produced, whether it was successful, and if cloaking was achieved.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **April 1956** — Author Morris K. Jessup states he received two strange letters from an alleged Carlos Miguel Allende who claims the USS Eldridge or the USS Engstrom were subject to an experiment at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. Allende claims he witnessed it, and the ship and its crew became invisible temporarily, before experiencing side effects. Allende later tells APRO the “Philadelphia Experiment” was a hoax, but then states the CIA “coerced” him into saying it was a hoax.

Allende was later identified as Carl Allen, who also admits to writing the annotations in the Jessup/Varo book that ONR chose to copy (see April 1956). Ufologists later link the alleged experiment back to T. Townsend Brown, the founder of NICAP, but it is an unproven claim.

Coleman claims Air Force Manual section 190-4 was in effect as of this date and after, affecting all USAF press releases, statements to Congress and the public, and publications about UFOs. Coleman later tells NICAP that AFM 190-4 requires the Secretary of the Air Force Office of Information to delete all evidence of UFO intelligence control, which contradicts the official stance at the time that true UFOs didn’t exist. He
admits that Maj. Lawrence J. Tacker’s book was reviewed under the regulation, something the Air Force previously denied. Coleman states even if Tacker wished to provide UAP evidence, it would have been prohibited.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **Late 1956** — The General Physics Laboratory of the Aeronautical Research Laboratories/Aerospace Research Laboratories (ARL) at Wright-Patterson AFB hires physicist Joshua N. Goldberg to administer multiple contracts related to relativistic theories of gravitation. Goldberg works here until 1963, before joining the University of Cincinnati for a year and moving on to other universities. Curiously, fellow anti-gravity researcher Louis Witten joined the University of Cincinnati after his contracted work for Wright-Patterson ended in 1968 (see 1955).

Goldberg states in his CV he worked for the Armour Research Foundation in Chicago, IL for four years before being recruited to ARL, working on applied research for industry and government. It is
unclear if Goldberg or ARL worked on UAP-related research but the many possible linkages in the PUBLIC DOMAIN are interesting. Hubert Goenner of Goettingen, a former participant of RIAS (see 1955), writes ARL may have also studied Soviet efforts in anti-gravity.

Vesco states a craft called the “Feuerball” developed in Oberammergau in Bavaria (OBF) could interfere with Allied craft with intense EM fields.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **28 February 1958** — USAF Director of Information Services Maj. Gen. Arno Luehman writes he had informal discussions with the Senate Committee on Investigating Government Operations that “there is no need” for hearings on the UAP subject. The USAF writes that it is attempting to guide the Subcommittee to issue a statement certifying the Air Force is properly conducting its UAP investigation and not withholding information from the public. These conclusions are reached as a result of informal meetings and zero investigation is performed.

Rogers states jet fighters from Zaragoza AFB, Spain were scrambled and began interacting with the lights. “The UFOs suddenly began moving around really quickly and erratically.” After the event, Rogers said he and a few companions who saw the event were told to get into an Air Force sedan, driven to the headquarters building, put into different rooms and debriefed. Rogers said they may have been OSI but he wasn’t sure; they threatened him, told him not to talk, forced him to sign a non-disclosure statement and shown a regulation “AFR 200-2.”

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **17 March 1961** — USAF ATIC is asked by the House Armed Services Subcommittee how the USAF can improve UAP sightings. ATIC states the best solution is to give its primary advisor J. Allen Hynek a raise of $1,000 per year and purchase one new polaroid camera and one new geiger counter for field work. It also recommends raising the count of commissioned officers working on UAP from 1 to 2.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **13 November 1961** — USAF document “AFCIN-1E-0 Draft Policy” written by Lt. Col. Norman M. Rosner to Col. Betz writes that intelligence team personnel are needed to support Air Force **Projects Moon Dust**, **Blue Fly and “UFO,”** and other quick reaction projects. The document gives the 1127th Field Activities Group at Ft. Belvoir responsibility for UAP “collection
responsibilities,” and importantly, divorces these responsibilities from Moon Dust and Blue Fly, described as projects to locate, retrieve and deliver foreign space vehicles.

The document also distinguishes crashed UAP from Soviet/Bloc vehicles, and describes the need for quick reaction recovery teams. For decades after, the USAF continued to rely on the conclusions of Special Report No. 14 to debunk UAP, which stated no compelling physical evidence had ever been recovered from UAP, despite debris collection teams existing.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **1962** — USNR test pilot “PJ” states he saw a saucer at WPAFB in 1962 while attached to the 354th TAC Fighter Wing deployed to WPAFB on a hurricane evacuation from Myrtle Beach AFB. He and five men walked through the base looking for a gym and entered the Special Services Hangar and burst through the doors only to see an air police sentry with a sub-machine gun guarding a 12-15 foot by 8 foot object saucer with no rivets, roped off, guarded by eight guards. The guard told them “I don’t think you’re supposed to be here, Sir,” to which they left and believed the US developed flying saucers.

When he returned to Myrtle Beach AFB he was debriefed by his Brig. Gen. and was told he broke security, asked if he saw anything (to which he replied nothing), to which the Brig. Gen. Said “You have the right answer to the question.” PJ had a TS clearance that allowed him to fully research gaining valuable insight otherwise impossible. PJ was puzzled by the lack of security and wasn’t in a test facility, suggesting that it was near the flight line because it had just arrived or was awaiting deployment.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **Late 1964** — USAF Lt. Col. Philip E. Moore states that while at Walker AFB, NM, he was on duty in one of the 579th Strategic Missile Squadron’s underground Atlas ICBM launch control capsules. Moore was at 579 Site 7 when he and his commander Maj. Dan Gilbert got a call from 579 Site 6 or Site 8, south-southeast of Roswell, NM, that a UAP was hovering over their location. It would hover, rapidly leave, and then return. The hovering was reported by crew as “instantaneous” movement from Site 6 to Site 8 and back, repeatedly.

Though Moore states he was never told not to talk about it, in 2005, he stated: “I personally believe that there is something to the UFO-ICBM connection. I know the Air Force covers up when it feels the official need. UFOs over ICBM sites could be one of those official needs.”

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **10 December 1965** — An anonymous Air Force security team member at Lockbourne AFB near Columbus, OH states he guarded an object on 10 December 1965 after it arrived from Pennsylvania. He states it was there for the morning and sent to WPAFB. Another source, a truck driver, states he saw a flatbed trailer with an object shaped like a “bell” under a tarp sitting upright.

This matches what witnesses say they saw crashed in Kecksburg, PA on 9 December 1965, a bell shaped object. John Podesta stated in 2003 that it was questionable how the “unexplained crash” records were not released by NASA.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **18 January 1966** — Two surveyors are taking readings at China Lake Naval Ordnance Test Station (now Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake) see a UAP flying straight at them from the north. It passes overhead less than 150 feet, dives smoothly, turns east and comes within 10 feet of the ground before flying over the horizon. The surveyors say it is traveling at 150mph, dull black, quiet and its presence interfered with their radio. They also have a theodolite and notice the gravity reference indicator exhibits an “odd” change.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **3 April 1966** — Rep. Gerald R. Ford states the Air Force assured him an upcoming scientific study on UAP (what would become the Condon Committee) would not be connected “in any way” with the Air Force. Ford was dissatisfied with **Project Blue Book** and was seeking an independent analysis.

This assurance was later revealed to be untrue, as the USAF provided Condon with an “informal liaison” to assist with “certain technical activities” to analyze cases, a declassified memo shows.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **5 April 1966** — USAF Maj. Hector Quintanilla tells the House Armed Services Committee that **Project Blue Book** had “no radar cases which are unexplained.”

Declassified records show this is a lie, as the Project was cataloging at least one radar “unknown” per month in its first year alone. **Blue Book** scientific advisor J. Allen Hynek later corroborated this, providing several radar unidentifieds such as 1951 Goose Bay, 1956 Lakenheath and 1957 Shreveport.

Hynek also noted Quintanilla’s deception in a book written six years later.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **21 July 1966** — The FBI tells multiple U.S. citizens UAP is not and “never has been a matter that is within \[its\] investigative jurisdiction.” This contradicts many now declassified files including a 1957 memorandum where SAC Kansas City writes the FBI Director about a film of a UAP taken by a U.S. citizen, suggesting it be retrieved, sent to HQ and coordinated with AFOSI. The FBI also admits in a 1952 memo that it did “conduct some investigations regarding flying saucers,” but reached an agreement with USAF to refer cases to them on 27 September 1947.

>**_Note_**: A 4 February 1948 memo from USAF Capt. Richard W. Guess states USAF commanders are charged with evaluating incidents, but they’re to be passed to local FBI offices. FBI seems to have had an ongoing relationship with USAF where UAP data was passed between local offices and USAF. One example of this is on 15 May 1952 where FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover writes AFOSI about flying discs seen above an AEC facility in South Carolina.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **3 July 1967** — Marine “RT” with Alpha Red TS Crypto Clearance states he was at a CR site in 1967 where he departed from Camp Pendleton to a retrieval site “somewhere in the desert” on 3 July 1967. When he landed there were tents and a pre-fab hangar and at the site were men in fatigues without insignia. RT was assigned guard duty. RT states he looked inside the hangar and saw a metallic disc with a dome on top with no windows, around the craft were men at work and tables with technical instruments. A large walk-in refrigerator unit on skids had several empty body bags.

RT states he was seen looking into the tent, escorted to the officer in command Col. “P”, USAF Medical Corps, reminded of his Security Oath and confined to his quarters before being sent back to Pendleton for punishment. RT states when he called APRO about the CR he began receiving threats, he was visited by an intelligence agent and reminded of his Security Oath, his apartment was pillaged on 21 July 1980, visited on 22 July 1980 and threatened where RT performed a citizen’s arrest with a gun and the police booked the man before another man in a “limousine” showed the police their credentials and he was released.

On 28 July 1980 RT states he was visited by a man dressed in black who offered to exchange UFO information and it was the last call made. The visitor’s ID allegedly said CIA. After his admissions RT then got a job at the AEC and stopped telling his story of the CR.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **March 1968** — The Defense Intelligence Agency monitors a crashed “circular metal disc” recovered in Nepal. Four months later, a State Dept. cable subject line “Moon Dust” (referring to a covert USAF **Project Moon Dust** at the time to recover space debris) writes to the DIA, 1127th at Ft. Belvoir, WPAFB, Andrews AFB and MacDill AFB that a diplomatic visit to Kathmandu was a “fishing expedition” for info on “space objects.”

Another cable shows the Royal Nepali Army showed photos of four space objects to U.S. officials, and Nepal’s defense secretary asked the U.S. if it had determined the origin of one object. A possible cover story of a crashed satellite is given, despite NORAD and NASA data showing the Cosmos 208 satellite launched in March 1968 was a success.

>Belvoir had responsibility for recovery of foreign space vehicles under **Projects Moon Dust**, **Blue Bly and UFO**. That document distinguishes UAP recovery from crashed Soviet/Bloc vehicles and describes the need for quick reaction teams. The above cable suggests the 1127th monitored and possibly attempted to retrieve the circular metal disc in Nepal.

>**_Note_**: The presence of MacDill AFB on the cable is potentially significant because the location is linked to rumors of housing four reverse engineered flying disc craft with tail fins witnessed by ret.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **June/July 1971** — U.S. Navy Yeoman Third Class James M. Kopf is on the USS John F. Kennedy in the Caribbean Sea completing an Operational Readiness Exercise when communications messages begin coming in garbled. Ship radar, compasses and electrical systems then stop working. Kopf and others go outside and see a large, pulsating orange sphere sitting silently above the ship. It lasts for about 20 minutes. Two days later, commanding officer Capt. Ferdinand B. Koch tells the crew certain events are to be considered classified.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **May 1972** — **Project Blue Book** scientific advisor J. Allen Hynek writes that **Blue Book** was a “cover up” and that the UAP problem was “glossed over.” Hynek said he felt his hands were tied, and if he complained, the USAF and Pentagon would pull his access to case files as retribution.

Hynek also writes he suspected **Blue Book** was a “front” for a more classified investigation, stating he was told to drop one case and told by higher-ups “not to pursue the matter further.” This is significant because for decades the USAF used **Blue Book’s** conclusions to debunk UAP to the American public and Congressional inquiries.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **June 1972** — An ad hoc group with Franklin Mead, Senior Aerospace Engineer with the Air Force Aerospace Research Laboratories, is editor of a technical report on **Project Outgrowth** at the Air Force Rocket Propulsion Library at Edwards Air Force Base. An entire chapter of the report is devoted to Antigravity Propulsion, utilizing the concepts of gravitational screens and a unified field theory.

Hardware described is “theoretical,” but specifies that it is worth it to determine which materials/metamaterials might change the amplitude and direction of gravitational fields. “No new or radical change in fundamental physics \[is\] required,” it writes.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **May 1973** — USAF Col. William T. Coleman and Col. George Weinbrenner allegedly meet with Hollywood documentary filmmaker Robert Emenegger and producer Allan Sandler and encourage them to make a documentary on UAP and its extraterrestrial origin. They are told they’ll have the government’s full cooperation and exclusive access to classified footage of a UAP landing in 1971 at Holloman AFB, NM. Coleman and Weinbrenner claim the film shows “alien visitors” and their meeting with members of the U.S. government. Emenegger is told there are multiple extraterrestrial groups and the military is monitoring at least one other group the Holloman entities don’t know about. After pre-production, permission to use the landing film is withdrawn.

>**_Note_**: This story is alleged but if true, highlights the Air Force’s attempts to shape public opinion through mass media and possibly “disclose” UAP on the USAF’s terms in 1973. It is curiously similar to meetings with USG officials, Lockheed Martin personnel and Clinton campaign personnel in 2016. Those meetings led to the formation of To The Stars Academy of Arts & Science with former USG employees and contractors from the intelligence community in 2017 whose release of three UAP videos shaped mass media.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **June 1973** — Great Lakes Naval Base instructor RK states a UAP was shot down by the US Navy with a surface to air missile, retrieved from the ocean and taken in secret by rail to the Great Lakes Naval Base under heavy guard. RK states he guarded the object in Chicago and it was shot down in the Pacific; it was in a large quonset hut. While on guard, he was approached by an officer in a jeep who handed him a sealed envelope for the Commandant in the hut, to which he saw a metallic craft, 30 feet long and 10 feet high resting on a wooden platform.

It was light silvery blue and shimmering, tapered like a tear drop with a flange running along its topside from one end to the other and there were no windows. RK states he heard it was shot down by a missile between Hawaii and the mainland in June 1973, and was picked up on a destroyer’s radar and made three close passes. RK states he heard the object was retrieved by a Glomar Explorer, shipped to Hawaii, and then sent Stateside and to Chicago.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **October 1973** — Sgt. Michael D. Jenkins, 96th Security Police Squadron at Dyess AFB, TX worked security over nuclear-armed B-52 bombers. The base had a nuclear weapons storage area as well. Jenkins states he and his squadron were ordered to draw arms from the armory and patrol after a large spherical UAP was seen over the weapons storage area. Jenkins states he heard an order to “move it out of the area,” afterward hearing gunfire and seeing a “streak of bluish-white light moving at high speed” out of the base. “It was the UFO getting out of there,” he states. Jenkins and others were told not to speak about the incident under penalty of court-martial.

Jenkins states the next day he saw a Top Secret teletype that chemical analysis had been done on a thin, strand-like physical substance recovered outside on the base property. Neither Congress nor the American people at the time were aware that physical evidence was being recovered after UAP events.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **11 October 1973** — Civilians Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker claim they see an oval UAP and are taken aboard the craft by “robots” for examination near the Pascagoula River in
Mississippi. Hickson refused to take a polygraph, but former **Project Blue Book** advisor J. Allen Hynek stated the testimony was sincere.

Parker claims his father once worked for the Atomic Energy Commission near Area 51, and the sighting occurred near a shipyard managed by Ingalls Shipbuilding, then owned by Litton Industries, creator of advanced space suits for the USAF and NASA. The appearance of the alleged entities Hickson and Parker saw may match the description of advanced experimental suits Litton was designing at the time. Was this event a military test of some kind using “UAP abduction” as a cover?

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **March 1974** — A large self-illuminated object hovers above the Romeo-29 launch facility at the Malmstrom AFB Romeo Flight missile alert facility near Brady, MT. A missile launch officer with the 564th Strategic Missile Squadron reports a nuclear missile countdown is started, and the officer flips the “inhibit” switch to turn the system offline. The system then restarts spontaneously and the missile again goes into launch mode; the officer’s next “inhibit” order doesn’t work. Fortunately, the launch code is false and the missile remains in its pad.

The UAP then moves away from Romeo-29 vertically at high speed. An F-106 attempts to intercept but is unsuccessful and Malmstrom AFB radar tracks the UAP. Electronics in Romeo-29 are fried from an electric surge. This event occurred at a time when the USAF was referring Congress and the American public to the findings of **Project Blue Book**, which concluded UAP were not a national security threat. The Romeo-29 event very clearly was a threat to national security and nuclear war.

Dallas van Hoose, Army spokesman at Redstone Arsenal, states “unexplained aerial phenomena” were observed during ballistic missile exercises the previous year. In one incident in August 1973, he stated, Vandenberg AFB launched a Minuteman ICBM to Kwajalein missile range; on its descent at 400,000 feet, radar scanners began tracking a UAP next to the ICBM nose cone. Radar picked up an inverted saucer-shaped object to the right and above the nose cone, and watched it pass in front of the warhead (while maintaining its speed) below and to the left before disappearing. In addition to Maj. Hoose, none of the experts journalists spoke to could explain the event. Ufologist Barry Greenwood later stated he filed FOIA inquiries for records and Vandenberg replied that the records were destroyed and unavailable.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **26 April 1976** — A CIA teletype admits “offices and personnel within the Agency” monitor UAP phenomena, but not on an official basis. The document says the efforts of independent researchers are “vital for further progress,” implying the Agency may have monitored U.S. citizens’ own investigations into UAP.

Four years later, D/NFAC wrote to DCI stating DCI working groups were analyzing unexplained events and Soviet science and technology “enigmas.” An official CIA history of involvement with UAP
downplays Agency interest in UAP in the 1970s and 80s and makes no mention of the Agency’s interest in independent researchers or DCI working groups.

Despite knowing it was being investigated for abuses, the CIA still wrote in 1976 that U.S. citizens’ investigations into UAP would provide value to its own intelligence collection activities, possibly indicating the Agency was considering further abuses to monitor civilian UAP groups.


**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **1977** — USAF Sgt. M.S. of the 97th Bomber Wing claims while serving at WPAFB in 1977, he made the acquaintance of a Maj. Gen. whose last name begins with the letter “T” assigned for security work in the Logistics Command; his daughter dated M.S. M.S. claims Gen. T. Told him a UAP crashed in the Southwest in 1957, four bodies were recovered and badly burned but their silver spacesuits were not damaged and fused to the flesh, and sent to WPAFB for deep freeze; the heads were larger than the bodies but facial features were erased by the heat; a CR team got into the craft through a fissure in the shell; it was transported by rail using cover as “classified rockets” to WPAFB.

M.S. claims Gen. T showed him a TS document about a UAP landing at Nellis AFB in 1968 reading “Large UFO hovered over Nellis AFB for three days. Three small alien craft were observed separating (or being ejected) from the parent craft. One landed on the Air Base grounds. Sent to greet the landed craft was a Colonel with security detachment properly armed. There was no mention of an attempt to assault the craft. While waiting for a sign of intent, a humanoid was observed to disembark from the UFO craft, which was described as ‘short and stocky.’ Then a beam of light was directed at the Colonel. The Colonel was instantly paralyzed, according to the report. Orders then came from the officer next in command for his troops of the security detachment to fire, but their weapons were mysteriously jammed. The Colonel was recovered and hospitalized.”

Leonard Springfield claims he corroborated the existence of Gen. T. At WPAFB through the Accounting and Finance Section records. Stringfield also claims another Intelligence source corroborated the 1968 Nellis AFB incident.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **November 1977** — USAF Security Alert Team member Mario A. Woods Jr., stationed at Ellsworth AFB, SD, states he flashed a spotlight at a possible UAP to attempt to communicate and it responded. Hours later, Woods and his team partner responded to an penetration alarm on the outer zone of the site, witnessed the UAP at a distance and again directly over the site. It was a red-orange sphere “constantly swirling and churning.”

Woods next states they looked at the object, he felt like he couldn’t breath and looked at his colleague who had a blank stare on his face; he too could not breath. Woods flashed a flashlight at the object and the pressure went away. He next states he sees “something like shadows” outside the vehicle and hears voices in his head “Do not fear” repeatedly. He next sees five or six “small figures” walking toward the vehicle before passing out.

Woods regains consciousness at dawn, after four hours have passed, and he, his team partner and their truck are near Newell Lake, miles from the site. They are found and recovered by Ellsworth personnel and debriefed by AFOSI. Woods was ordered to take a urinalysis and skin samples. Woods states he has two small puncture marks on his skin under his left armpit and above his ankle, and he often has “strange dreams of that night…every time, as something was about to happen or show itself, a great dread came over me. I would awake in a pool of sweat and afraid.” It is unclear if Congress has been made aware of possible abductions of USG personnel and certain the American people have not been made aware of this possibility.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **18 January 1978** — Alleged USAF Incident/Complaint Form shows a UAP sighting incident and body recovery at Ft. Dix and McGuire AFB. The form states it was distributed to Col. Landon and Brig. Gen. Brown at AFOSI. It states a UAP sighting occurred over Ft. Dix and an “unidentified being had been shot by Dix MPs.” “Some kind of body found” and the area was cordoned off, and recovery teams notified.

Retired USAF Maj. George Filer III claims he was there, the recovery team acted like it had seen that type of incident before, and states he was denied access and never cleared to see photos. He claims he heard that the being was gray/brown with a fat head, long arms and slender body.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **19 September 1978** — NASA Associate Administrator for Space Sciences Noel Hinners testifies to the House Committee on Science and Technology with respect to “extraterrestrial intelligence research.” Hinners makes extensive references to the search for ETI using telescopes and the possibility of life somewhere else in the Universe.

Hinners decides not to mention, though, that NASA elected eight months earlier to study physical evidence retrieved from UAP on Earth if presented with it. In fact, it was Hinners himself responsible for a letter sent to Southeast Missouri State University in Cape Girardeau, MO that stated NASA would receive “bona fide physical \[UAP\] evidence.” One year later, a letter to Hinners from a colleague writes the UAP physical evidence program is ongoing, known as “UFOHEAP,” though it seems to be unfunded.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **16 February 1979** — Memo from FBI SAC Albuquerque to FBI Director writes that New Mexico State Police officer Gabe Valdez claims the Department of Energy and Los Alamos National Laboratory are attempting to “cover up” the cattle mutilation phenomenon.

FBI monitors interest in the phenomena from Sen. Harrison Schmitt; documentation suggests Schmitt may have been misled by DOE/LANL as well.

>**_Note_**: Sen. Schmitt ended up organizing a conference on the cattle mutilations in 1979, hosted by defense contractor BDM Intl. BDM also curiously employed former Dir. of Naval Intelligence RADM Sumner Shapiro, who told NASA engineer Bob Oechsler about reverse engineered UAP shipped to different government laboratories in a conversation in 1989. BDM also hosted the “Advance Theoretical Physics Conference” to study UAP under DOE supervision, see entry 20 May 1985 for more details. It is a natural question as to whether or not Sen. Schmitt’s cattle mutilation conference was able to reach any relevant conclusions given the involvement of a contractor possibly involved in deep black UAP work, possibly unbeknownst to Schmitt.

Marchetti also states he heard rumors at high levels of the CIA of “little grey men whose ships had crashed, or had been shot down, being kept on ice by the Air Force Foreign Technology Division at Wright-Patterson AFB.”

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **27 June 1979** — Anonymous informant claims in a forested area in southeastern Oregon near the Idaho border, near a hunter campsite, a UAP crash allegedly occurred on this date. The informant was charged with loading crates onto helicopters and by the time he arrived at the crash retrieval, the object had been removed from the deep ruts it created in the Earth and placed on a
semi-trailer covered by a tarp, it looked disc like with a dome; pieces of strange metal had fallen behind the trailer onto the ground dull grayish-brown in color.

After he cleaned up the site and it was evacuated, he was soon “abruptly” transferred to embassy duty in Central America for several months; the informant also states he viewed UAP “artifacts” and bodies at Grafford AFB in Nevada on Thanksgiving weekend in 1973 or 1974 before being abruptly transferred to Guantanamo Base in Cuba for several months.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **July 1980** — AFOSI counterintelligence officer Richard C. Doty delivers a forged anonymous letter to U.S. civilian UAP investigative organization APRO. The fake letter claims a Civil Air Patrol cadet Craig R. Weitzel photographed a UAP landing near Pecos, NM. The letter claims Weitzel was soon visited by a man from the Department of Energy contractor, Sandia Laboratories, who told Weitzel the UAP was from Los Alamos National Laboratories and Weitzel shouldn’t have seen it.

The letter also claims crashed UAP are stored at the Manzano Nuclear Weapons Storage, and that Sandia examined it. Doty later stated the letter was disinformation to see if APRO would be “useful idiots” and admitted AFOSI was targeting U.S. citizens with psychological operations.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **17 November 1980** — AFOSI counterintelligence officer Richard C. Doty delivers a forged document to physicist and Coast Guard veteran Paul F. Bennewitz. Doty states he was ordered by his superiors to confuse Bennewitz, who had observed an NSA laser project at Kirtland AFB from his own property near the base. Doty convinced Bennewitz what he saw was of paranormal origin, UFOs, and Bennewitz developed delusional paranoia and was committed to a psychiatric hospital as a result of AFOSI’s actions. Sen. Peter Domenici met with AFOSI; existing documentation suggests AFOSI may have also misled Domenici because it did not inform him of the disinformation targeted at Bennewitz.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **14 December 1980** — “Larry W.” writes Leonard Stringfield and claims that while at Arizona State University in 1975, a classmate of his “Mr. DR,” told him he witnessed a UAP “capture or retrieval” in 1968 while in the Army attending intelligence school in a remote desert area of Texas, approximately 50 miles from Big Spring, TX.

One mile from the Army compound was a small 16 acre USAF “facility” too small to be considered a full fledged base; it was restricted, well guarded and patrolled; Larry claims it had a large
metal building and warehouse, 1-2 small guard houses and a nearby concrete helicopter landing pad, with no airstrip or runway, surrounded by an 8 foot chain link fence topped with barbed wire.

He claimed he and other classmates observed unusual activity at the USAF site, which was only entered or existed by blue, officially marked USAF vehicles; large flat-bed trucks entered the warehouse but none to his knowledge ever left; he stated he believed a large underground workshop was set up beneath the warehouse; within months, he received written orders not to observe, talk about or go near the USAF facility; 5-6 of his classmates decided to find out what was going on and tried to enter the facility wearing USAF fatigues, they were not heard from for a month and all but one returned to the school with apparent psychological effects.

Two to three months later after this breach, all Army personnel were restricted to their quarters and windows were blacked out; a small group went to a crawl space in the attic above their bunks and removed some of the roof’s shingles to look out, seeing an “intense twinkling light descending in rapid, jerking movements,” that was changing colors, diminish in intensity and take a shape, before dropping to the ground; “it was in no way a conventional craft,” it was relayed to him; the object was disc shaped with a small bulge on top, the air shimmered around the craft as if it were hot, and no occupants were seen; USAF personnel surrounded the object when it landed; the next morning the area was clear.

DR states in 1971 he was warned by a Col. not to mention anything about UAP and Big Springs
Base.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **1980s Undefined** — The fake USG document AFOSI counterintelligence officer Richard C. Doty delivers to Bennewitz makes its way to the American public and is the subject of various books and media.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **July 1980** — Sunn Classic Pictures releases the film Hangar 18 about a cover-up following a crashed UAP in Arizona; the craft in the story is taken to the fictional “Wolf AFB” in Texas where it is analyzed. The occupants are described as near-human and match a similar story told to Linda Moulton Howe by AFOSI counterintelligence agent Richard Doty at Kirtland AFB three years later.

Sunn Classic Pictures was established in 1971 by the Schick Razor Company, of which Patrick J Frawley was a co-founder with significant creative input.

Frawley was a knight of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta (SMOM), a Roman Catholic order with ties to the CIA and former CIA directors who served as knights including William Casey and John McCone. Frawley was also connected to the American Security Council as a member and donor, a military lobbying organization with membership of James Angleton, Nathan Twining and Douglas MacArthur, among others. Of note, Col. Philip Corso, who claimed UAP programs quietly encouraged film production for disclosure purposes, was a Shickshinny Knight of Malta, a breakaway group from SMOM.

Sunn also produced In Search of Noah’s Ark in 1976 at a time when the CIA was investigating Mt. Ararat as a location of the Ark (and mention Ararat in the film), The Amazing World of Psychic Phenomena about psi and TK during the predecessor programs of **Project Star Gate** and The Outer Space Connection, a film about the ancient alien hypothesis.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **1981** — Lawyer Andrew Basiago claims he served in a DARPA **Project Pegasus** in the 1970s which utilized time travel technologies to view different segments of human history. Basiago claims beginning in 1981-1983, he and William B. Stillings worked in a building at 999 N. Sepulveda Boulevard in El Segundo, CA operated by Hughes Aircraft. Basiago claims there is a “jump room” at this location that allowed for full teleportation of humans to a network of different jump rooms.

>**_Note_**: Basiago reiterates these claims in public media and in a signed affidavit alleging **Project Pegasus** gave the DOD foreknowledge of the 9/11 attacks. Basiago claims knowledge of the “Montauk chair” (see 1971) and suggests programs utilize “time viewing” technology for intelligence purposes and a secret space program utilizes teleportation technology far advanced beyond those in the open source.

>**_Note_**: In the open source, quantum teleportation was first proposed in 1993 and achieved in 1997. Most recently, researchers have teleported information between atoms dozens of kilometers apart and have transferred information between clouds of gas atoms. A recent study at University of California also suggested human brains were ready for teleportation due to a unique natural behavior of the hippocampus. Still, Basiago’s claims are astounding and suggest teleportation technology in the black is hundreds of years ahead of open source, if true, though they may very well be false claims.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **1982** — A USAF Capt. states while stationed at Fort Hood, in the late 1960s a pilot had to make a forced landing over a restricted air corridor at Gray AAF/Robert Gray Field. The pilot saw a huge section of land separating like giant sliding doors with vegetation intact revealing a huge corridor inside; the pilot was blindfolded and taken into the jeep inside the underground complex, inside a long corridor and interrogated by two men. He was blindfolded again where his aircraft was refused for him and was told not to speak of the incident.

In 1973, two witnesses saw a square UAP with lights and were approached by Chinook helicopters, who took up a tight formation around the UAP. The UAPs and helicopters disappeared out of sight; the next day, the witness called Fort Hood and was told there was a routine recon training mission in the area. Another researcher told the men who flew the helicopter were code named **BLUEBOYS** and it was a special group involved in UAP work. Another son of a man who allegedly worked underground beneath Fort Hood stated the technology involved is “science fiction.”

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **1982** — Kit Green states he hired a retired senior USAF officer who was a physician to work on a science board at the CIA. This man told Green “the stories about alien incursions, recoveries and information are true.” He told Green he would clear him for the programs, but this never happened.

Even during Green’s retirement while at General Motors, this USAF officer told him he’d get cleared but it never happened.

Green never named the individual but it was revealed he passed away in 1997, and later evidence shows this was likely Brig. Gen.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **5 May 1984** — An anonymous source claims to a journalist that a highly classified U.S. Defense Support Program spy satellite detects a UAP. It comes within 1.8 miles of the DSP satellite before flying below it over the Indian Ocean. It is moving 22,000 mph, changes course, and
allegedly flies back into outer space. This story made its way to the public not via a USG disclosure, but a documentary film.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **16 May 1984** — Army Dir. of Counterintelligence LTC Lance R. Cornine writes in a FOIA response that the Army briefly had an “in-house” group known as the “Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit” that unofficially analyzed UAP in the 1950s. The Directorate denied the existence of any IPU records, but three years later admitted records were transferred to the Air Force Office of Special Investigations. In 1997, AFOSI told FOIA requestors that its IPU material had been destroyed.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **24 July 1984** — Security police at Indian Point Nuclear Plant at Buchanan, NY allegedly see a UAP with lights oscillating yellow, white and blue. The plant’s movement sensors and alarm fails, and the computer responsible for security and communications fails. Police report it the length of three football fields and shaped like a cone. It passes directly over Unit 3 reactor for five minutes, and one officer films the object on camera. Over the next two days, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) reportedly reassigns the plant’s security operations and video and audio records of the event are removed.

>**_Note_**: The NRC was born out of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) alongside the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) in 1975. ERDA became the Department of Energy (DOE) in 1977. If AEC played a prominent role in early UAP analysis, crash recovery and transportation, key evidence may be split between these successor departments and agencies. The NRC for example was aware of a black triangular UAP over the protected area of Cooper Nuclear Station, NE in the late 1980s, and created an incident file. No formal investigation appears to have been conducted.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **1984/1985** — Technical Sgt. John W. Mills III, of the 394th Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Test Maintenance Squadron at Vandenberg AFB, states he was shown a highly classified film of three Minuteman III dummy warheads (Multiple Independently-targeted Reentry Vehicles, MIRVs) in flight during a test at Vandenberg. On the film, a small white object maneuvered near the warheads; two of them disappeared, one of them splashed down at the target site. Mills states contractors at Rockwell Autonetics Division, Space Data Corp, or Lockheed (he wouldn’t specify to protect their identity) showed him the film.

Mills also states he heard secondhand that a similar situation occurred with Peacekeeper missile tests in late 1984 or 1985. Contractors told Mills a light beam coming from space hit three of the five missiles. He did not see the footage because his clearance had been lowered at that point.

Maccabee doesn’t know if any findings were discovered.

Pandolfi later told Maccabee that a CIA archivist found no evidence of MJ-12 in the files. Maccabee also states Pandolfi admitted there might be a “mole” in the CIA working with a UFO control group or another agency but he wouldn’t tell him if he thought who that would be.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **29 December 1987** — CIA and civilian pilot John Lear, Nevada State Sen. candidate and son of William Lear, founder of Lear Siegler Corp, claims the USG has been “in business” with gray extraterrestrials since the 1960s.

His other claims: Germany may have recovered a saucer as early as 1939; Gen. James Doolittle went to Sweden to inspect a saucer that crashed in Spitsbergen in 1946; in 1947, Truman established MJ-12; in the late 40s there was more saucer crashes in Roswell, Aztec and Laredo, TX; one saucer that
crashed in the 1950s was so large that logistical problems prevented it from being transported and it was buried; the logistics stories are “legendary” and include moving only at night, purchasing whole farms, cutting down forests, blocking major highways, driving 2-3 trucks in tandem, etc.

He also claims on 30 April 1964, the first communication between aliens and the USG took place at Holloman AFB; they made a “deal” in exchange for technology the USG would ignore abductions and the EBEs told them abductions were merely monitoring; in fact, abductions were the insertion of implants, implementation of posthypnotic suggestion, termination of some people so they could be biological material, termination of people who are a threat, genetic experiments and impregnation; he claims in 1979 there was an altercation at the Dulce laboratory; by the 1980s, MJ-12 was concerned the mistake they made dealing with the EBEs and began to promote positive film projects like Close Encounters and ET; some of MJ-12 meeting at the “Country Club” wanted to confess the scheme, the other majority chose to develop anti-UAP weapons under cover of SDI.

Franklin Mead, head of Project Outgrowth 16 years earlier, is listed as the project manager for Veritay’s paper on a 21st Century

Propulsion Concept. The contract is intended to explore the Biefield-Brown effect, which allegedly converts electrostatic energy into propulsion. The program experimentally explored if the concept existed and if it could operate in a vacuum, and determined it could not recreate the Brown effect.

>**_Note_**: This study is meaningful because it shows that in the PUBLIC DOMAIN, Edwards AFB could not recreate the Brown effect based on the work of Thomas Townsend Brown, the very effect Mark McCandlish testified (see 9 May 2001) was used to develop USG recreations of UAP craft.


**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **April 1988** — Science Applications International Corp (SAIC) studies electronic propulsion for Edwards AFB, again for Franklin Mead, Chief of the Future Technologies Section (see June 1972 and April 1988). According to SAIC investigator Dennis Cravens, assistant director of Los Alamos National Laboratory’s Center for Explosive Technology Research Pharis Williams was essential to the research.

SAIC, citing Williams, suggests a five-dimensional theory of thermodynamics could lead to a unified field theory and novel propulsion methods. The report also mentioned antigravity was not achieved using a rotating cylinder filled with mercury, but that the research should be reconsidered in the future.

>**_Note_**: Pharis Williams has several indirect ties to UAP research. Los Alamos colleague Oke Shannon told a journalist in 2019 “if we were to build an anti-gravitational device, it would be built on the principles involved in \[Williams’\] theory.” Shannon attended the 1985 “Advanced Theoretical Physics Conference” under DOE supervision led by USAF Col. John Alexander to determine if UAP evidence supported an R&D program. The meetings were held at BDM Intl’s McLean Secure Facility and classified using DOE controls (see second note under 28 April 2006). Shannon’s name was also mentioned on the alleged meeting notes between Dr. Eric Davis and VADM Thomas R. Wilson where a secret UAP program was discussed (see 16 October 2002).

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **June 1989** — USAF Capt. Richard P. Osedacz writes an unclassified paper at the Air Force Institute of Technology at Wright-Patterson AFB stating a database of UAP in near-Earth orbit exists and has existed since at least 1972. UAP events tracked by NORAD are termed “fastwalkers.” Osedacz writes NORAD tasked the USAF Foreign Technology Division, Flight Performance Division (FTD/SQDF) to analyze unknown datatracks.

The paper adds that “undocumented” simulations were performed on UAP in the Space Surveillance Center within NORAD Cheyenne Mountain Complex.

>**_Note_**: On 6 January 1967, **Project Blue Book** scientific advisor J. Allen Hynek told a crowd at the Goddard Space Flight Center that NORAD and SAC radar had tracked UAP. Beginning in 1957 with the establishment of NORAD’s command headquarters at Ent AFB in Colorado Springs, CO, every continental U.S. military radar UAP case in **Project Blue Book** files is a NORAD case because the subordinate USAF Air Defense Command belongs to NORAD.

>**_Note_**: As noted on the entry for September 1979, NORAD refused to share UAP data in response to a FOIA request without charging $294,000. The fees were never waived and the data, despite seemingly unclassified as Capt. Osedacz suggests, was never made public.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **July 1989** — Commanding Officer of WPAFB Brig. Gen. Arthur Exon states “the Unholy Thirteen” was a UFO controlling committee in the 1950s and states he was told Roswell was recovery of an “alien” spacecraft. Says bodies could have been taken to Denver, but also suggests they went to Wright Field. He states members included USAF Sec. Stewart Symington, USAF Chief of Staff Carl Spaatz, Gen. Eisenhower, Gen. Ramey, etc.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **17 September 1989** — Jacques Vallée writes there is a “large disinformation campaign” surrounding UAP but he still cannot find exactly what it is covering up. Vallee writes that Art Lundahl of NPIC, Kit Green, Adm. William Houser and Gen. Tommy Johnson all told him they didn’t think a black project was active, but it is unknown if they were obfuscating or unaware.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **28 September 1989** — An anonymous USAF Col. states (to anthropologist George Dickson) a SDI weapon was used to down a UAP in Moriches Bay, Long Island; the craft crashed into the “Dune” area where it was retrieved; he claims there were 18 military fatalities when the occupants retaliated; they were killed by the use of a weapon which generates extremely low frequency sound waves which can destroy the molecular cohesiveness of known matter.

On that same date, a commodities broker claims he saw helicopters transporting a large object and three other witnesses claim they saw jeeps and military vehicles with a police escort going to Brookhaven National Laboratories that morning. An anonymous scientist “Dr. Nick” at Brookhaven told LIUFON a large object was recovered and transported there, adding it weighed very little; he claims it was wedge or boomerang shaped, he had previously worked at “S-3” beneath WPAFB to study UAP; and the technology was crystalline-based; he states the weapon was developed by AIL Electronics and it was tested at Fort Meade, MD five months prior. He stated he had been threatened not to talk about this.

“Joseph Z.” wrote Leonard Stringfield and claimed he had access to classified government records; per three Pentagon computer systems the next day, Z claims no weapons were deployed, NAVSYCOM had been tracking a polar-orbiting satellite with a decaying orbit and considered a radiation hazard; Office of Foreign Technology requested US Coast Guard helicopters to provide illumination from
above; command/control aircraft circled above; remnants were transported to a nearby parking lot and loaded onto flatbeds, and taken to Brookhaven National Laboratories via William Floyd Parkway; local police were instructed to reroute traffic at 4:22am on 29 September 1989 because of the potential radiation hazard; radioisotope elements were removed from the wreckage at Brookhaven and placed in secure storage for disposal as waste, and remaining wreckage were transported to an undisclosed location for examination by the Office of Foreign Technology on 30 October 1989. Phil Imbrogno states published NASA data showed no Soviet satellite tracking reports in that area on that day.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **October 1989** — NASA mission specialist Bob Oechsler meets retired RADM Sumner Shapiro under the pretext he is interested in working with the “group” that manages UAP information. Oechsler gets the intro to Shapiro from Bobby Ray Inman, former NSA Director and CIA Deputy Director and Board member of SAIC and Wackenhut at the time. When Oechsler meets Shapiro he is retired as former director of Naval Intelligence, and works as an executive with BDM Intl.

Shapiro tells Oechsler parties in the US are in possession of extraterrestrial space vehicles and suggested he studied one at close quarters. Shapiro states teams would take the craft apart, pack them up and ship them around the country to different laboratories. Shapiro states the crafts had interlocking components that has to be taken apart in a specific sequence to get it to come apart/put back together.

>**_Note_**: BDM has several linkages to UAP besides employing Shapiro (see 26 September 2022). In 1988, BDM was purchased by Ford Aerospace and became a part of Ford Motor Company. In 1990, Ford Aerospace was sold to Loral and BDM was spun off to the Carlyle Group. In 1997, BDM was purchased by TRW, an aerospace and technical services company, which was acquired by Northrop Grumman in 2002. Northrop Grumman maintains a major corporate facility in Tysons Corner near the old BDM Intl. headquarters today.



**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **1990** — Sgt. Dan Sherman, while working on an NSA project with a USAF ELINT cover, claims he is told that there is another level of secrecy above Special Access Program for certain projects. He claims certain black SAPs are actually covers for “alien” projects known as Level 1; grey projects; grey matter or slant missions. He is told within grey projects there is as expected
need-to-know inside that.

Sherman is told by a Cpt. White that he is only aware of one being **Project Preserve Destiny**, to establish intuitive communications with NHI. But he assumes there are other grey projects.

Sherman states he is taken to a facility a half an hour from Fort Meade, MD, but that his transportation is blacked out and he is never told exactly where it is. He then claims he is “taught” intcomm in classes that consisted of listening to tones and trying to repeat them by mentally humming them (not verbal).

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **1990** — Henry Azadehdel (pseudonym Armen Victorian) interviews Eric Walker, former president of Penn State University and former chairman of the Institute for Defense Analysis, of which ARPA came out of. The alleged transcript claims Walker told Azadehdel that entry into a UAP “control group” cannot occur unless an individual knows about their “seventh sense,” i.e. ESP. Walker states “only a few” know about ESP and only then would you have a chance of being taken into the control group.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **1990** — Jane’s Defense writer James Goodall cites direct interviews conducted over the previous decade that led him to believe there are at least eight black programs flying out of Groom Lake including a silent triangle. “Unconventional” technologies are in use. A source he knew for 12 years at Groom Lake told him “positively” that UAP exist, and another source told him “we have things out there that are literally out of this world…better than Star Trek or anything you can see in the movies.” No further explanation is given.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **1990** — Lt. Col. Ron Blackburn of Lockheed Martin Skunk Works and co-founder of the ATP Group, tells Jacques Vallée he was directly involved in the construction of
TRESTLE while at Air Force Weapons Laboratory (AFWL). TRESTLE was a large EMP simulator that could create an EMP without a nuclear blast. McDonnell Douglas was awarded the contract for the construction of the TRESTLE and BDM was awarded a subcontract for electromagnetic analysis, timing and control equipment.

BDM and BDMMSC (BDM Management Services Company) were also awarded contracts for operation and management of the TRESTLE. BDM produced at least ten papers on subjects like EMP hardening, EMP simulation and EMP effects on aerospace vehicles, many of which were produced under Department of Energy contracts.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **1990** — A ret. physicist who claims to have worked closely with Oppenheimer, Einstein and Teller states in 1990 that he worked on a special project at Edwards AFB in the late 1960s/early 1970s on **Project Blue Heaven**. The source states a flying saucer and its crew landed at Edwards AFB and its occupants were carted off to a secure building for evaluation. The disc was kept in a big hangar with armed guards with possibly hundreds of people working on it.

The source states the occupants had eyes of one color, a nose, a mouth, and teeth that looks like they were made there. They were dressed in a silvery looking material with elements not of Earth, and their blood looked like oil. The bodies were light brown, and the researchers came to the conclusion because there were no deterioration, to leave them alone because another craft might come and rejuvenate/reactivate them. The craft had no seams, no rivets, no welding with a dome at the top.

The other scientists told him it was made of a material they “never dreamed could exist,” and they had not figured out how to cut a hole in it. The ret. scientist states the project is still active at the time of disclosure (1990), and it was run by the DOD, while the Navy had 2-3 similar research projects. He also states Nixon had awareness, and some bodies were at Homestead AFB, corroborating Jackie Gleason’s claims of seeing bodies at Homestead. His security went from the President through the Director of the CIA to him.

The scientist referred to a special group of scientists that worked with the President called the “Special Committee.” He states he changed some parts of his story re: the craft in 1991 and alluded he had to protect that information as he was in contact with an office in Washington D.C. that had been established over the last 6 months to make a decision on “how to keep everyone from finding out what is really going on.”

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **1 October 1990** — William Scott writes an article in Aviation Week about 45 sightings in the southwestern US. Objects show near-hover capabilities before accelerating to supersonic. Scott concludes there are at least two types of aircraft beyond the F-117A and the B-2, claiming one is triangular shaped and the other is a high-altitude craft seen with a pulsing light. Scott claims they are using “exotic” propulsion systems, and sightings occur near Edwards AFB, George AFB and the China Lake Naval Weapons Center. In one instance, an unidentified triangular craft was seen escorted by two Lockheed F117-As.

Former UK politician Simon Parkes states “reptilians” are in control of a soul recycling system. Buddhism teaches reincarnation is an endless cycle of suffering only broken by enlightenment, while ancient Greek Gnosticism teaches humans are divine souls trapped in the physical world where escape can only be achieved by not worshiping the false god (Demiurge), but rather, gaining secret esoteric knowledge about who humans really are, where they are from, how parasitical entities work and how how to be free of a soul trap ran by entities they refer to as “Archons.”

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **July 1991** — A ret. USAF Col. tells ufologist Tim Cooper early UAP were thought to be German, used nuclear power in a way not understood and were composed of metals and plastics not known on Earth. The USAF panicked when it recovered flying discs in the Mojave Desert and New Mexico, he claimed, and transported them to Muroc AFB and Langley; they were lifting bodies that looked like inverted bathtubs that looked like a “pod” or short-range recon probe. Von Braun, Condon, Oppenheimer and Teller worked on scientific research of the crash retrievals he claimed.

The Col. had “no comment” on “who” helped them and suggests it was ET, but doesn’t explain. He states there were other USAF projects besides **Blue Book** that were UAP related including **Project Black Book** or **Project Black Sky** that used advanced cameras and sensors on high altitude aircraft like the X-2, X-15 and U-2, plus cameras on rockets that were launched from White Sands and the Cape to look for UAP. He also claims he heard of a USAF Project White Book that looked into historical UAP sightings including some from the Vatican back to the 15th century; allegedly the Vatican has UAP sighting photos going back to 1915 of all shapes and sizes rumored to be locked in a vault room inside the Vatican Basilica and even the USAF could not get access.

He states **Talon Gold** and **Teal Ruby** were programs for satellite recon objectives and led to the foundation of the NRO, and raw UAP data was processed by the Technical Reconnaissance Squadrons at NORAD at Ent AFB.

Henderson, states in an affidavit that her husband in 1980-1981 picked up a newspaper at a grocery store in San Diego and saw an article describing a crash of a UFO outside Roswell with bodies of aliens; she states he told her “I want you to read this article, because it’s a true story. I’m the pilot who flew the wreckage of the UFO to Dayton, Ohio. I guess now that they’re putting it in the paper, I can tell you about this. I wanted to tell you for years.” She states he described the beings as small with large heads for their size; their suits were made of material different than he had ever seen and they looked strange; they were packed in dry ice; he had not been aware of the book the Roswell Incident at that time.

Mary Groode, Henderson’s daughter, signed an affidavit and said a similar story, that he showed her the newspaper article and said the bodies were small, pale, with slanted eyes and large heads, and there were three of them. He also told her on one occasion when they were looking at the stars that he was “looking for flying saucers…they’re real, you know.”

CSETI’s Steven Greer states he gave the document to Admiral Thomas Wilson, then J2 and later Director of the DIA, whom Greer claims Wilson recognized one of those entities and it was being run by a contractor. Greer claims Wilson called the contractor and they told him he didn’t have a need to know. Greer alleges the program was UAP related and one of the entries on this document led Wilson on his quest to find an extragovernment UAP reverse engineering housed in a legacy aerospace corporation outside of USG oversight.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **25 November 1991** — Two scientists connected with the the DIA and NSA claim in a face to face meeting that USG/USG contractors are engaged in programs that attempt to control non-human intelligences (NHI) and harness those NHI for military and intelligence purposes. The scientists claim the work has engaged in satanic ritual and human sacrifices, and that although some efforts to use NHI are for “good,” they’re convinced what is being tapped into is “evil.”

The scientists claim the research of David Bohm has been expanded upon; that everything exists everywhere at once enfolded into an invisible timeless medium. They show the journalist photos of individuals killed during psychotronic weapons experiments, that some UAP sightings are the projections of physical 3D objects by undisclosed projects, etc.

The scientists claim NHI can work unseen to humans; create incisions and perform medical procedures that are undetected; create the illusion of being extraterrestrial beings, phantom helicopters, etc.; that the ET scenario is disinformation to protect NHI projects; the NHI established contact in psi/mind control weapons development programs; NHI are spiritual beings that can control human minds, monitor them and possess individuals; that NHI seek to deceive human minds to prevent belief in their conqueror (suggested by scientists to be of Christian origin, “Jesus Christ”).

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **1992** — USAF Staff Sgt. Dan Sherman claims he spent 1992-1995 in the USAF training as an ELINT analyst at the NSA, which he claims was a cover as an Intuitive Communicator between humans and extraterrestrials. Sherman claims he was told in 1947, the USG had contact with a Star Visitor Race, the Zetas/Greys; a program was begun in 1960 with the assistance of the Zetas to “genetically manage” a select number of humans to communicate with ET intuitively.

Sherman claims it was called **Project Preserve Destiny**, and that there are programs above Waived Unacknowledged Special Access Programs known as “grey programs” that consist of human-ET collaborative efforts. Sherman claims these grey programs are given black project covers. Sherman claims at Andrews AFB he was taught to interface with ET and relay those messages to his superiors. He claims an ET he communicated with told him changes were coming to Earth, souls exist, God exists and Star Visitors were influencing Earth civilizations for a long period of time before present day.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **9 March 1992** — Maj. Ed Dames also claims aerospace company Alien Technology Transfer asked government contractor Psi-Tech to “do some anti-gravity work.” Some of the vehicles in their possession, he claims, have “very nice technologies” that the people building the B-2 bombers (Northrop Grumman) “would like to have.” Dames claims Psi-Tech “transfer\[s\] the technology.” Dames claims remote viewers were also used to attempt to view the development of the UAP technology by the occupants.

Dames also claims Psi-Tech personnel had an in-house project for ten years on a UAP “site,” suggesting this data was gathered by remote viewers in DIA/USAF/CIA projects before the company was founded. It is possible this site was Iron Mountain in New Mexico, which Jacques Vallée claims he was taken to by Dames, Ron Blackburn and others in 1990 and Maj. Gen. Albert Stubblebine referred to during the ATP Group meetings. Other members of Psi-Tech include David Morehouse, Col. John Alexander, Lyn Buchanan, Paul H. Smith, Mel Riley, Joni Dourif, Dane Spotts, Courtney Brown and Aaron Donahue.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **9 March 1992** — Steven Greer explains at the 1992 TREAT IV conference, he is pulled into a hotel room with Maj. Gen. Albert Stubblebine and people who were “connected to covert programs and black operations, corporate, military and intelligence — this hybrid MJ12 successor entity.”

Greer states the gathering became a “barrage” of questions directed at Greer and one person asked basically “who the hell do you think you are, going out there, basically bypassing the national military command to do this?” Greer asserted his citizenship allowed him to do this, but Stubblebine didn’t agree;

Dr. Joseph Burkes claims the Maj. Gen.’s assistant left the room for 45 minutes to consult with someone who was not in the room and upon the return, he took Stubblebine aside to relay something; Stubblebine then told Greer “Okay, you can do it. You have our permission.” Greer claims Stubblebine recruited him to join their group and they would give him “as much money and as much power and as much access to technologies as you could ever dream.”

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **13 May 1992** — Michael Riconosciuto, who provided Inslaw Inc. with an affidavit in support of their lawsuit against the DOJ, claimed he was hired to program a secret backdoor in the software used by IC agencies. Riconosciuto also was a source for journalist Danny Casolaro looking into Wackenhut weapons testing on Native American reservation land, and he also claimed a joint venture between Wackenhut and Meridian Arms at the “Nevada Testing Range” were able to polarize molecules by modifying the electric field, a technology developed from exploring Thomas Townsend Brown’s suppressed work.

Riconosciuto claims this knowledge was gained from working at Lear in Reno, NV and from working with Gerald Bull of Space Research Corporation. Sources close to Riconosciuto also claimed other IC sources that were unsubstantiated stated there was a “war” in the intelligence community between a group centered in the CIA called Aquarius (around a powerful center known as MJ-12) and a group known as COM-12 centered around Naval Intelligence. COM-12 was allegedly trying to leak information damaging Aquarius. Also alleges the Jicarilla Indian Reservation is being used for testing around an underground facility in Dulce, NM.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **22 May 1992** — Former consultant to **Project Blue Book** and eventual **BAASS**/**AAWSAP** subcontractor Jacques Vallée writes in his diary that he met with Richard D’Amato. D’Amato at the time was counsel to the Senate Appropriations Committee under Sen. Robert C. Byrd. D’Amato tells Vallee that he looked into triangular UAP like those seen in Belgium from 1989-1990. D’Amato believed the craft were human and the project that makes them was illegal. “No money was ever appropriated for it. Intelligence groups like AFOSI continue to cover, distort, destroy data and generally make it impossible for Congress to find out what’s going on,” D’Amato added.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **24 November 1992** — The book UFO Encounters by JB Michaels states locals believed a UAP crashed in Southaven Park near Brookhaven Lab on this date. John Ford, an investigator of this incident, stated he was worried for his safety; he told Michaels the UAP was shot down by a plasma beam using quark gluon technology via R&D being done at Brookhaven; he also claims DOE had done anti-UAP directed energy weapons testing in the past using technology at Brookhaven and Los Alamos. Of note, Mona Rowe, an employee at Brookhaven at the time, said she saw a UAP near the facility at the time of the alleged crash retrieval.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **22 December 1992** — British embassy in Washington D.C. writes to assistant chief of Air Staff in London re: USG reaction to triangular UAP sightings. Specifically, three years earlier, British Royal Observer Corps (ROC) member Chris Gibson witnessed a triangular UAP refueling from a KC-135 Stratotanker alongside two F-111s. The sighting became public in 1992, after which, British officials monitored USG reaction: “Secretary of the Air Force, Donald B Rice, was to say the least incensed by the renewed speculation…that he had lied to Congress by stating that Aurora did not exist.” \[Aurora was a rumored name for a USG/USG contractor triangle craft reverse engineered from UAP technology.\] British intelligence writes the situation caused “considerable irritation” within USAF.

Notes made by someone inside OSTP state that Kit Green was involved in briefing OSTP while he was with General Motors and OSTP’s belief that Rockefeller and Bigelow’s interest in MJ-12 was irrelevant because “MJ-12 are bogus” and it feeds into paranoia of “new world order” to target Clinton. Presumably the notes are made by Jones. Jones previously served as an aide to Sen. Claiborne Pell from 1985-1991.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **1994** — Former New Mexico State Rep. J. Andrew Kissner states sources within White Sands Proving Ground and Naval Research Lab told him flying discs led to USG personnel deaths in 1947, that 2-4 flying discs were recovered that year, and the craft were processed and analyzed by the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC)’s Los Alamos National Laboratory and its Z Division at Sandia Base. Personnel from the JRDB, MIT, Brookhaven National Laboratory, RAND Corporation, NACA and the Rockefeller Institute also played “major roles” following the 1947 crashes, Kissner stated. He adds that Project Supremacy could have been UAP related, specifically the triangulated radar sites set up in New Mexico in late 1947; he states the 4062nd AISS group was at all three sites and responsible for UAP data collection per AFR 200-2.

Kissner added his sources told him the custody of the flying discs was given to the AEC and its national laboratories by classified Presidential Executive Order in July 1948, with the National Security Council (NSC) serving as overall program coordinator with support from Air Force Systems Command, the Naval Research Laboratory, and the Research and Development Board. Kissner unfortunately did not reveal his sources, which were never vetted. In 1974, the AEC was reorganized into the Energy Research and Development Administration and in 1977, the ERDA was reorganized as part of the Department of Energy (DOE). One year after Kissner’s allegations, the DOE told the GAO it could find no records from 1947 related to UAP crashes.

>**_Note_**: On 29 January 1947, Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson and Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal established the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP), an agency to manage nuclear weapons jointly staffed by the Army and Navy. AFSP and Los Alamos National Laboratory’s Z Division established operations at Sandia Base at that time in New Mexico. It is worth determining if these facilities were ever utilized for UAP research as well, like Kissner suggests, and if elements of UAP research are controlled by AFSP/AEC/ERDA/DOE legacy classification mechanisms.

Dudgeon states he was in the Yard at the same time as the DE173 USS Eldridge, and the Navy was trying to make the ships “invisible to magnetic torpedoes by degaussing the vessels.” Dudgeon states this is a “big secret” not that Eldridge was involved in space/time experiments. Vallee concluded the Philadelphia experiment story was disinformation to protect a very legitimate experiment.

Brandenburg claims he sees an image of a mile wide linear structure that looked artificial and “shouldn’t be there.” He states he was told when the Clementine mission was completed “not to interfere” with “an elite department team with the highest security clearance” that analyzed the images taken on the dark side of the Moon.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **Early 1994** — Sgt. Dan Sherman claims while at PPD location 1 and performing regular USAF ELINT duties as a cover for periodic **Project Preserve Destiny** intcomm duties, he receives his first comm from a source alleging to be NHI. The comms were as follows:

“Prepare for information string.”

Sherman provides the following as a sample: “118/67555/995500400043/47477899055/9400///“ He says all comms began with 118, a five digit “zip” and then the comms.

Sherman says the early comms were just numeric and he did not know who at NSA was receiving them once he inputted them into the terminal or what they meant.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **8 March 1994** — Muskegon, MI National Weather Service radar operators see three radar returns, moving in unison bouncing in altitude between 7,000 to 12,000 feet altitude.

Residents on the ground corroborate this with reports to local police of multi-colored UAP in the same area. Soon after the sighting, a NWS spokesperson downplays the event saying the returns were not correlative with the UAP sightings, ignoring key evidence. In 2020 a local reporter told a resident he was told to kill the story by an unknown individual. In 2022, the NWS radar operator said he “kept his mouth shut” due to ridicule inside the NWS.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **Early 1995** — Sherman moves to PPD location 2. He does not disclose where this is but his transfer sheet suggests it is again a facility where USAF ELINT for is performed and a select few perform intcomm work too. He begins periodic numeric information string intcomm which like before he inputs into his terminal and is presumably sent to NSA.

A few days later, the second NHI at this location began communicating with him on the “higher plane.” Sherman says over the next 10 months they communicate on the higher plane several times, to which he learns the following: time does not have the same meaning for NHI and they can travel around time but not through time; the NHI says that any entity that realizes its own existence and has intellect has a soul; NHI has visited Earth for a very long time; Basque people are most likely to be hybrids; EM is used as propulsion; our Sun is unique; multiple countries are involved in PPD; Earth is in “geological infancy” and humans should expect “much change.”

Sherman also suggests the black project that cloaked PPD had to do with noise cancellation technology but that he was never briefed on it, it’s only his suspicion.

One of them was to remote view the moon and alleged “humanoids” operating on the back side of the moon; another duty was to accompany a figure known as “Axlerod” to a secret location in the Alaskan wilderness where a triangular UAP periodically appeared as if on schedule and showed signs of interdimensional travel.

The object approaches the wing of the commercial plane, then minutes later, the USAF craft. According to FAA audio records, Albuquerque ATC contacted NORAD’s Western Air Defense Sector HQ at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, who informed ATC that NORAD was tracking a “search-only track” for 3-4 minutes where the UAP was reported. However, in the following months NORAD said it was a small aircraft whose transponder was not working.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **28 July 1995** — Rep. Steven Schiff comments on the release of a General Accounting Office (GAO) report detailing an audit related to an alleged UAP crash in 1947 near Roswell, NM.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **August 1997** — NASA sponsors a breakthrough propulsion physics workshop at the NASA Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field in Cleveland, OH. Vacuum fluctuation energy, warp drives, the use of electromagnetism for antigravity and superluminal quantum tunneling was discussed.

The workshop occurred at a time when Salvatore Pais, later inventor of the Navy’s triangle craft patent (see 2 November 2017), was working on his PhD dissertation at Case Western Reserve University while serving as a NASA Graduate Student Research Fellow at the Glenn Research Center. Twelve students were in attendance according to workshop proceedings, but it is not disclosed if Pais was in attendance. It is certainly possible, given his Navy triangle craft patent utilized vacuum fluctuation energy concepts.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **1 August 1997** — NASA Marshall Space Flight Center physicist Ning Li, with David Noever, Tony Robertson, Ron Koczor and Whitt Brantley of the University of Alabama in Huntsville, publish a paper that states recent experiments show a rotating, superconducting disc made of yttrium-barium-coper-oxide (YBCO) is able to reduce the mass of an object suspended above it by 0.05% to 2.1%.

Li reportedly left NASA in 1999 to found the company AC Gravity LLC. AC Gravity was awarded a DOD grant for $448,970 in 2001 to continue anti-gravity research, ending in 2002. No results from the DOD research were ever made public, though the company still existed as of 2021. Ning Li passed away on 27 July 2021.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **3 August 1997** — National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) historian Gerald K. Haines publishes what claims to be an extensive report on the CIA’s role in the study of UAP between 1947-1990. Haines says **Project Blue Book** purposefully covered up NRO overflights of U-2 and SR-71, deeming them unidentifieds or natural phenomena, but provides no evidence. **Blue Book** head Robert J. Friend states the story is “laughable,” implying that Haines’ report was created to purposefully wash away
the national security concerns of true UAP. Nonetheless, the news media picks up the NRO report and the concept that there is nothing to UAP circulates, and is promoted by CIA and NRO web properties.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **19 August 1997** — Ret. USAF Col. Steve Wilson claims a secret space program utilizes Vandenberg AFB and Beale AFB and is involved in shooting down unfriendly UAP. Wilson claims the craft used are reverse engineered man-made UAP such as the “pumpkinseed” craft. Wilson provides an org chart that shows Decision Science Applications Inc. (DSAI), which he claims consists of the directors of the relevant UAP black budget divisions from Rockwell, Martin-Boeing, IBM, Lockheed, McDonnell, Ford Aerospace (now part of Northrop Grumman), Aerojet Electro Systems, Teledyne Ryan Aeronautical (now part of Northrop Grumman), Kaman Industries, Rockefeller Company, Wackenhut and Fujika Company. He claims former Adm. Bobby Ray Inman leads DSAI.

Wilson claims there were 36 “MJ-12” members as of 1994, and this group exists in an intricate web that receives funding from Rockefeller Co., which also allegedly funds some of the companies mentioned above, and have personnel overlap between those contractors and NORAD, CSOC, the NRO, NSA, CIA and the Executive Branch.

*   (IV) AC/RF or microwave EM devices based on the work of Alzofon, Tesla, Littlejohn, Sweet, Nielsen, Seike, Hutchingson, Farrow, Bielik, Zinser, Peshka, Schlecker and Smith.
*   (V) Solid state devices using antigravitic/shielding based on the work of Podleketnov and Schnurer.
*   (VI) Nuclear antigravitation that allegedly causes a breakdown of Newton’s third law based on the alleged work of Bearden, Wallace, Dan Fry, GIlbert Jordan, the claims of Robert Lazar (element 115) and Charles Brush. It is alleged that cold fusion with zero-point energy interaction can achieve this effect.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **1998** — USAF Master Sgt. Edgar A. Fouche states he temporarily worked at the Defense Advanced Research Center (DARC) in 1979, which he claims is a facility beneath Groom Lake with at least 10 underground stories. Fouche states he was recruited to DARC while he was working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) at Edwards Air Force Base, which also had underground facilities.

He states a full antigravity propulsion system was developed, there is a secret space fleet using this technology, and he overheard conversations that suggested quasicrystals were an enabling technology for propulsion and communications.

Fouche also claims triangular craft have been built that are mistaken for UAP, contracted by Lockheed, Boeing, Northrup, Teledyne Ryan and managed by the NRO, NSA and CIA. Fouche claims the triangular “TR-3B” provides logistics and transportation support for the secret space program and they house a minimum of four crew members, the top 1% of elite pilots from the Navy and USAF. Fouche claims at least three prototypes were built and use “MFD” technology built from reverse engineering UAP at Sandia and Livermore. Fouche claims mercury-based plasma is pressurized, heated and rotated to create a magnetic vortex field which allegedly “disrupts” gravity’s effect on mass by 89%.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **11 March 1998** — Author Nick Redfern claims a source who was put into contact with him from AFOSI states a group of current and former IC personnel who believed UAP were demonic in origin called the “Collins Elite” published a lengthy document summarizing their beliefs. The report is not published but extracts are; they state the following: “STAC Reports (I to XI) describe the fall, collection, analysis and present whereabouts of unusual fabrics, foils, parchments, chemical residuals and biological material found at found locations in Lincoln County, New Mexico between 3 and 13 July 1947.”

The report mentions the Collins Elite met at the Loftus Boat on 23 May 1997 and that the Collins Elite was unable to convince CIA S&T at “PTC” of viability of sharing with the Collis Elite the “completed NORTH files on NM discoveries of 1947…S&T at PTC are aware of our briefing from STAC on their files but are reluctant to share NORTH material due to security issues that developed from the Nebraska debacle.”

>**_Note_**: The “Nebraska debacle” may refer to the 25 November 1991 entry where two scientists connected with the the DIA and NSA allegedly claim in a face to face meeting in Nebraska that USG/USG contractors are engaged in programs that attempt to control non-human intelligences (NHI) and harness those NHI for military and intelligence purposes.

“STAC remain committed to advancement to media and population of both Mogul and extra-terra scenarios for NM fallings and discoveries and are troubled by Collins Elite wishing to advance THE THEORY to media and population. This writer privately engaged STAC Markale in conversation on 17 June 1997 and provided him with an amended copy of New Mexico Origins: Parsons, Hubbard and Babalon Working. Markale remains convinced that if placed into public forum knowledge of THE THEORY will irreversibly and negatively affect global social order.”

“This writer privately explained to Markale that Collins Elite initiatives prepared ot ensure a reasonably acceptable transition of the perceived true nature of the Lincoln County discoveries to public and media, as well as a reasonable long-term acceptance of THE THEORY can still proceed with limited social disorder if handled correctly. Markale is not convinced and speaks for the STAC membership.

Presently STAC-5 is privately sympathetic to the position of Collins Elite; he reiterates the position of CANDLE on 4 May 1991 that STAC is now “in too deep” with its attempts to reverse-control the situation and prevent enemy infiltration and deception beyond present levels.”

“This writer sees that disagreement on our part with STAC is unlikely to inflame situation beyond present levels due to STAC’s genuine sympathy with difficulties created for everyone by recent developments. STAC-5 informs this writer STAC totally rejects notion that Collins Elite’s Learning the Way paper that theorizes radically indoctrinating population with belief and faith — and revelation to media and population of true nature of Lincoln County discoveries — can halt enemy infiltration.”

“This writer remains greatly troubled by STAC decision to continue its relationship with contractors Jamison and Wylie who — according to STAC-5 — are still convinced that the “PARSONS TECHNIQUE” can assist in holding off the deception, infiltration and final invasion. This writer adheres to Collins Elite conclusion based on a reading of the original STAC Reports (I to XI) that any attempt to follow the path of Parsons will only result in a catastrophe of the type warned about in Parsons, von Karman and Goddard: A Door Unlocked.”

“STAC-5 understands this but consistently feels the need to reiterate that situation has gone too far for STAC to back down. STAC-5 also informs that WPAFB sources have had some success using the “PARSONS TECHNIQUE” in achieving spontaneous brief laboratory manifestation of materials very similar to two of those that “fell” at Lincoln County, NM in 1947. STAC-5 is of opinion that if long-term manifestation and stability of materials can be achieved and precise originating point of materials can be determined then this will assist NASA-TZER mission to answer the critical questions posed in our 1991 briefing to STAC, _Entry Points — And How Do We Keep Them Closed?_ ”

“Until final outcome of STAC, NASA-TZER and WPAFB research in this area is known this writer recommends that Collins Elite continues to focus attention on planned disclosure to public of THE THEORY if STAC, NASA-TZER and WPAFB attempts to “close the door” are not satisfactory. This writer concludes that if this hypothetical stage is reached disclosure and intense indoctrination of faith and values at planetary level to radically and rapidly alter current population mindset is the only alternative that may prove successful in thwarting plans of enemy.”

“This writer considers the disclosure to media and population of the Lincoln County fabrics, foils, parchments, chemical residuals and biological material to be crucial and integral in terms of revealing the “Trojan Horse” aspect of THE THEORY. STAC-5 understands this too and agrees that only if present attempts by NASA-TZER and WPAFB-1T to prevent widespread infiltration and enemy deception fail that revelation, explanation of the “Trojan Horse” aspect of the Lincoln County fallings and indoctrination may be only viable alternatives.”

“This writer is encouraged by confident comments from STAC-5 that if present and near-future operations fail to achieve success STAC and Collins Elite would provide a united front that would allow THE THEORY to be presented publicly and quickly and in a way that was acceptable to STAC. For that reason and likelihood that enemy infiltration will not be thwarted by STAC and NASA-TZER methods \[deleted\] has prepared a unique briefing paper on the Lincoln County Trojans in the event that immediate and emergency dissemination of facts to media and population is required.”



**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **17 June 1998** — Ufologist William Hamilton states he met an anonymous Colonel who was an aerospace engineer and a consultant to NASA. The former Colonel claims he
worked at several underground facilities and entered a secret undergrad Mag-lev train system at White Sands Proving Grounds. The Colonel allegedly knew someone who worked on a US antigravity program, who told Hamilton the public space program was a “sham,” and there was another “secret space program.” The secret space program uses craft and astronaut crews out of Vandenberg Air Force Base; craft capable of traveling eight-tenths the speed of light.

The source also alleged he worked hand in hand with a different race of human-like beings who were guiding their American counterparts. He states he worked in underground facilities on UAP derived technology at China Lake, Edwards Air Force Base and the Nevada Test Site.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **22 August 1998** — CSETI, an organization that collects testimony from hundreds of military witnesses, states it believes a covert entity utilizing an “Unacknowledged Special Access Program” security framework manages some aspects of the UAP matter and is (1) global in scope,
(2) has multiple levels of sub-compartmentalization, (3) exists in the privatized
contracting/work-for-others sector, (4) runs parallel to and separate from conventional intelligence projects and black projects and uses some for cover, (5) draws personnel from technology corporations and the intelligence community/military, (6) has access that’s based on project-controlled inclusion and not government oversight, (7) is funded by black budget monies and non-governmental capital, (8) maintains secrecy using force and illegal means, (9) has no oversight from the heads of USG agencies/offices it draws monies and personnel from and (10) has zero oversight from Special Access Program oversight mechanisms.

It is stated this covert entity possesses advanced technologies often mistaken for UAP, including “materialization/dematerialization,” faster than light travel and antigravity propulsion that is a threat to conventional military and constitutional chain of command. One intelligence source tells CSETI the “program” has considered the usage of manmade advanced craft in a “false indications and warnings scenario” in which the manmade UAP attack conventional military assets to make it appear there is an attack by hostile extraterrestrial life forms. The “program” is also allegedly considering the usage of technologies that “hoax” paranormal experiences in the consciousnesses of government/military targets, with adverse psychological effects. CSETI states this has already occurred and alien abduction scenarios are testing by assets of the “program.”

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **October 1998** — USAF Security Forces member Christopher Cabrera states he was stationed at Nellis AFB, NV at “Area 2,” a major nuclear weapons depot on the Nevada Test Site overseen by the Department of Energy (DOE)’s National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA).

Cabrera states while on patrol he and three colleagues noticed three bright UAP blinking in a triangle formation. The lights were extremely bright “it felt like it was daytime again.”

The group was later told to fill out an incident form, and told it “never happened” and they were never to talk about it amongst themselves or to anyone else. Cabrera states he was threatened by dishonorable discharge. The next day the Flight Chief addressed the entire staff saying there was no incident the night before. While at Area 2, Cabrera’s colleagues told him they experienced strange lights, disembodied voices and shadow-like “humanoids,” but Cabrera never saw anything else personally.

>**_Note_**: Former SSCI Staff Director and former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Christopher K. Mellon published a slideshow from the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (**AATIP**) while it was run out of the OUSD(I&S) on his website. The ninth slide describes **AATIP’s** DoD Threat Scenario, which states: “the science exists for an enemy of the United States to manipulate both physical and cognitive environments in order to penetrate U.S. facilities, influence decision makers, and compromise national security…DoD controls several facilities where activities have been detected.” It is unknown if the 1998 Nellis AFB encounter is one example **AATIP** was referring to, but it seems probable similar events are driving that statement.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **November 1998** — An allegedly leaked teletype is given to ufologist Tim Cooper from an anonymous “CIA official.” The document is sent to CIA’s “Weird Desk” among others, classified Top Secret “Jehovah” and discusses several items, including: the assassination of a Russian government source in charge of **Project Kohtpoa** (the Russian equivalent of USG SDI), tests in Kohtpoa had “hoped for positive contact but was not to be,” Russian source asking USG counterpart if results were
similar at Area 51/Dreamland, and the statement that “MJ Group” was seeking new funding before the “China problem surfaces.” Alleged funding sources for a clandestine (and possibly illegal) UAP management group were the “33 investors” and the IMF. The accuracy of this document has never been verified.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **8 January 1999** — Bob Bigelow states in a NIDS meeting that he remains fascinated by John Petersen’s brief of “Day After” disclosure scenarios and adds there needs to be a contingency plan if it is confirmed “we are cohabiting on the Earth with non-human entities that controlled out destiny.” On this date, Hal Puthoff also connects futurist Michael Lindemann with Petersen who would create first contact scenarios with sponsorship from Joe Firmage. Bigelow remains convinced UAP is a “scenario-selecting agent” which implies humanity’s acceptance of it will determine how and when confirmation occurs.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **23 January 1999** — An alleged “Burned memo” from MJ-1 to MJs 2-7 from the JFK era is sent to ufologist Tim Cooper from a source who claims he was a CIA CIA officer who worked for Jim Angleton. He states the memo did not officially exist but he took it from a fire; he also states he believes the files of **Project Majestic** and **Project Jehovah** will be pried loose and that the CIA monitors civilian UAP research to keep the community busy with disinformation. He also states the “burned memo” with directives was saved after a President Nixon SCEO ordered all MJ-12 documentation to be destroyed within the Agency.

The draft directives themselves state several things including that UAP questions from NSC, JC or President should not be disclosed unless UAP display overtly hostile intent and “full disclosure” is required by law; **Project Artichoke** and **Project MK-ULTRA** will be used in “population centers” to assist with MJ **Project Spike** and **Project House Cleaning**; and there is a “psyop” component of the MJ group.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **7 July 1999** — An alleged CIA source tells ufologist Tim Cooper the UFO control group ceased to exist in government in 1969 and became privately funded and was identified as **Jehovah** in 1992 and at one time was called **Zodiac**. He claims the original MJ-12 was a consolidation of two Pentagon projects **Majestic** and **Jehovah** overseen by a group of twelve institutions within military, intelligence and science; the highest classification as of the letter was termed SACRED, a follow-on to terms TRINE and UMBRA, he claims.

He states Majestic was a government panel appointed by President Truman to look into extraterrestrial contact and ways of detecting non-terrestrial signals, while Jehovah was a DOD project to back engineer recovered UAP hardware and research the physics of how the craft worked. He states J Robert Oppenheimer was appointed by Vannevar Bush to head Jehovah until the AEC took away his clearance in 1954, and by 1960, the group concluded UAP were a threat to US defenses and could instigate mass paranoia if they gained control of US defenses. In 1960 the source claims Eisenhower approved a joint defense plan written by MJ-12 that in the event the US came under a nuclear attack by the USSR through “EBE deception,” the US would not retaliate with the proposed USAF SIOP.

He also states in 1969, President Nixon was briefed by MJ-12 on UAP and all aspects of EBE problem since 1947, after which Nixon approved a SCEO that required intelligence community to purge all references to MJ-12 in their UAP files and to destroy documents that could connect MJ-12 to the JFK assassination. Recently, he claims the dilemma for those “in the know” is that extra-materialized entities (EMEs) have complete control over UAP and can appear anywhere as anything at any time; they have even deceived USG communication projects using remote viewing, he claims.

Other projects mentioned by him are a CIA **Project Environment**, which he claims along with **Project Medea** looked at damage caused by EMEs near nuclear facilities. The prevailing belief of the group is based on materials found in connection with an EME/UAP that a “worldwide invasion” is expected to begin by 2030.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **3 December 1999** — The Arlington Institute (TAI), a defense industry
non-profit, holds a board meeting with members including former CIA director R. James Woolsey, former Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban Development [Catherine Austin Fitts](https://home.solari.com/), and several media and financial industry executives. Meeting minutes show the group “had been approached” by a client to publish a white paper on the subject of life outside of Earth. Fitts later said the Undersecretary of the Navy was the client, who was interested in helping the Navy “adjust their operations for a world in which it was commonly known that aliens exist and live among us.” Fitts claims her time at HUD and after, as a contractor to HUD, exposed her to information that suggested slush funds were connected to FHA and HUD. Fitts believed some of the illegal funding was for domestic “clandestine military R&D,” some of which was UAP related.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **1999** — US Navy engineer and Space Technology Transfer Consultant David Adair states he was taken to Groom Lake, Nevada to see the landing of a test rocket. Adair states when he was taken there on 20 June 1971 he was brought to a low flat hangar that was empty; the floor was a hidden elevator and he claims he was brought down 20 stories. Underground, Adair claims he was shown a “symbiotic engine” the size of a school bus whose alloys had an iridescent sheen. Adair states there was no obvious wiring on the engine and his handlers became uncomfortable when he asked where it was from; when he was angry he didn’t get an answer, the engine behaved differently, he claims. Adair suggests the engine may be able to be powered by mental thought but did not know the mechanism.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **17 May 1999** — SFGate writer Hal Plotkin claims sources tell him the Department of Energy is possibly involved in “fraud and deceit.” Plotkin writes that SRI’s Michael McKubre is generating heat in cold fusion experiments but the scientific community has little interest. Plotkin also claims MIT chief science writer Eugene Mallove tells him the Bush Administration’s Energy Resources Advisory Board (ERAB) mislead the executive branch when it relied on a fraudulent MIT report that ignored findings of a successful cold fusion experiment.

The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI)’s Tom Passell tells Plotkin ERAB lied to Congress and told lawmakers cold fusion had no basis in further study despite knowing otherwise. He suggests DOE is ignoring successful cold fusion experiments such as those by Tom Claytor, and public DOE statements about failure rates are inaccurate according to their own scientists at Los Alamos like Claytor.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **31 July 1999** — EarthTech and former CIA scientist Hal Puthoff emails former CIA Life Sciences Division analyst Kit Green and his life partner Kristin B Zimmerman about a story published in a UFO magazine by a pseudonym “Greg Halifax” about a UAP crash retrieval personnel member pseudonym “Sedge Masters.”

The story refers to Masters having participated in a UAP crash retrievals group known as “**Zodiac**,” of which Puthoff states “we have reason to believe the set of stories are only slightly fictionalized versions of a source’s experiences writing up records for the archives at WPAFB.” Puthoff asks Green if he’s ever heard of **Zodiac**, “which is supposed to be the true name,” not MJ-12 or Majestic
12\. At the time, Green was the Chief Technology Officer of General Motors Asia Pacific, while Zimmerman was with GM Research and Development in the area of advanced design.

The Sedge Masters story itself describes the “blackest of American covert operations” that deals directly with UAP, collated from several different sources, and states a UAP management program exists that falls outside of the normal range of program activities and only members of the intelligence community with specific psychological profiles are selected. It states the program was called **Zodiac**, and had different subdivisions corresponding with different zodiacal signs, including Aquarius. It states the CIA had control over **Zodiac** as of the 1980s and between 1947-1980s, **Zodiac** recovered eleven UAP craft of different sizes and quality, some of which included live occupants of Nordic, small hairy, and tall “grey aliens” and short “grey aliens” appearance. Locations of recoveries listed include New Mexico, off the coast of Denmark and the Midwest.

In the story, an unnamed Col. tells a psychologist that during one crash recovery, a larger UAP “ship” appeared above the crash site and telepathically told the recovery team not to recover the craft. The team then experienced 90 minutes of missing time and were not able to share that information with staff at WPAFB until they were telepathically ‘released’ and able to do so; the psychologist states “the little gray bastards have thought control and empathy projection.” The story also states a file room at WPAFB has over 2 million accounts of UAP sightings by military personnel and US civilians, most of which were never investigated.

Dolan does not give the name of the TRW attorney he believes wrote the story and disclosed the name “**Zodiac**” for the first time publicly.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **24 February 2001** — A story is relayed to Jacques Vallée about cattle mutilations and a US Army black program. In 1977, Deputy Sheriff Jerry Simons under orders from Sheriff Darius Carter tracked three helicopters involved in a mutilation incident to Logan-Cache Airport. As Simmons tried to block a companion plane, he felt threatened by the helicopters and a man who got out of one of the helicopters. There was a US Army marking on the bottom of one helicopter but they were otherwise unmarked; the man proclaimed he had no identification and wasn’t going to provide anything, confidently smiling when the sheriff told him to stop the mutilations. Kit Green reacted to the report while Vallee heard it and suggested it was a USG black operation.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **April 2001** — In a briefing document presented to some members of Congress and the intelligence community, CSETI’s founders state a covert group controls some elements of the UAP issue using proprietary projects protected by corporate NDA and illegal special access programs (SAPs) protected by USG classification. The briefing states the group is quasi-private/public and operates transnationally, and is centered in industrial “work for others” contract projects related to the application of advanced extraterrestrial technologies. Compartments of the covert group are also involved in disinformation, public deception, UAP tracking and specialized liaison groups (to media, political leaders, scientific community, corporate community, etc). The individuals involved are personnel inside IC SAPs, black units inside corporate entities and select liaisons within the international community, religious groups, etc., the briefing claims.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **April 2001** — Ex Lockheed Skunkworks, USAF and CIA contractor Don Phillips claims Lockheed has extraterrestrial technology and “tremendous technological advances” have come from their study. Phillips states Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch is “getting pretty close” to what is going on, and adds that there is “a lot” going on in Utah, including where some of “our” associate scientists are working on UAP related technologies at private laboratories.

Phillips also said he started a company Light City Technologies Inc. where he mentions doing UAP related work and having access to certain technologies. He also suggests the company partnered with EG&G and contracted scientists to do work for them; it is unknown if those same scientists owned private labs in Utah where this work was being done.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **5 May 2001** — Jacques Vallée meets with a group including Jim Westwood, an intelligence consultant who had done extensive work for Hal Puthoff. Westwood claims to know that the MJ-12 documents are disinformation and suggests Roswell was a counterintelligence exercise designed to flush out spies. Westwood tells him a month later that “Puthoff really wants to find the hardware,” despite Westwood believing none such hardware actually existed. Westwood states an **Operation Shocker** used disinformation including false UAP data to trick Soviet Russia to believe the US had capabilities it didn’t; double agents were used for this.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **9 May 2001** — Aerospace illustrator Mark McCandlish testifies at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. that gravity propulsion research began in the 1950s and successfully reverse engineered recovered UAP to build three USG/USG contractor-made vehicles by 1981 and was kept secret. McCandlish describes their propulsion matches early concepts by Thomas Townsend Brown using electrogravitics.

McCandlish states he saw three antigravity saucers in a hanger at Norton Air Force Base allegedly called “Flux Liners.” He also claims Lockheed Martin at one time possessed a flying triangle shaped like a dart that flew with the blunt end forward, found in a crash retrieval operation in East Germany in 1989.

>**_Note_**: Thomas Townsend Brown served on the initial board of governors for U.S. civilian UAP research organization NICAP with Col. Robert B. Emerson, RADM Delmer S. Fahrney, Gen. William E. Kepner and Brig. Gen. Thomas B. Catron among others. While McCandlish states the UAP he saw were based off of Brown’s research, more recent studies by mainstream scientists show no anti-gravity effects and attribute the phenomena to ionic drift. NASA has studied Brown’s claims and found no anti gravitic force. It is unclear if McCandlish, an illustrator, was simply wrong about the reverse engineered craft’s theoretical construct and they do exist, or if he is fabricating the information.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **2002** — Author Nick Cook states Hal Puthoff (eventual **AATIP** scientist, see 25 March 2022) tells him the “evidence is pretty solid” that there are black budget aerospace programs that contravene white world understanding of the laws of physics. Puthoff states the most likely candidate for exotic propulsion is the perturbation of space-time by understanding the link between electromagnetism and gravity.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **1 March 2002** — A General Exon tells Eric Davis that two types of materials were recovered from Roswell: a light material with the consistency of balsa wood that was metallic and could not be broken, and a purplish foil with burn marks that could be crumpled up and would return to its original shape. Exon says beams discovered at the crash site had inscriptions. He did not know about any bodies but says the balloon story was a cover up.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **5 March 2002** — Kit Green writes to Jacques Vallée and tells him he spoke with an Air Force physician, Brig. Gen. Donald Flickinger, MD. Flickinger told Green in 1994 that years earlier he saw “alien autopsy” materials when he was the first Air Force MD to make the rank of General Officer. Flickinger worked on manned spaceflight projects and after that, worked in the VIP health program in Green’s division of the CIA. Flickinger claims the autopsy materials were real, something Green also says: “I have never believed the notes were hoaxes.” Vallee writes this is credible evidence of a secret program with access to biological materials. Days later, Eric Davis says a Lt. Col. Dr. Robert Parvin Williams is alleged to have participated in an “alien dissection”; Puthoff also gives the names Dr. Robert Crowley and Col. John Grime.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **25 April 2002** — CMDR Will Miller writes to Eric Davis and Hal Puthoff and offers them his contractual services into research of UAP crash retrievals and entities within the government and outside of government that are “involved in that business.” Miller states he could do this without touching information that is classified. Miller also states he has particulars on a special team involved in (as a secondary mission) recovered crashed craft including the F-117; Miller states he knew the team, its successor, the parent sponsoring entity and two key officers who could provide information on UAP crash retrievals.

He also states he knows the name and last location of a senior officer who had first hand knowledge of USG alien reproduction vehicles (ARVs) at Area 51 and associated locations, and that he knew the name and current location of a retired senior flag-rank officer who was directly involved in government interaction with a significant UFO event on the east coast of the US. Miller finally states he has a list of civilian government contractors who most likely have involvement and knowledge of USG work in “alien-derived technologies, crashes, landing and associated events.”

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **29 July 2002** — BBC News publishes a story that claims researchers at Boeing are using the work of Russian scientist Eugene Podkletnov (see 4 February 2020) to create an antigravity device. BBC reports the project is run in “top secret” by Boeing Phantom Works, and states documents they obtained show it occurs in a **Project GRASP** (Gravity Research Applied to Space Propulsion).

Boeing denies it is funding the project with company money, and then states it cannot comment on GRASP or “black projects.”

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **29 July 2002** — Jane’s Defense Weekly reports Boeing **Project GRASP** documents it obtains state “if gravity modification is real, it will alter the entire aerospace business.” GRASP’s objective is to explore anti-gravity and evaluate Eugene Podkletnov’s experiments. Boeing
states this technology could impact space launch systems, artificial gravity on spacecraft, aircraft propulsion and fuelless electricity generation.

GRASP documents also state the work could be engineered into a radical weapon; high-power experiments using an “impulse gravity generator” can produce a beam of “gravity-like” energy that can exert instantaneous force of 1,000g on any object, enough to vaporize it. Boeing GRASP documents state its examination of Podkletnov’s work show a gravity beam laboratory in Russia can already repel objects up to 200 kilometers away, something that could be used as a ballistic missile shield or anti-satellite weapon.

Boeing attempted to work with Podkletnov directly but were not allowed to due to Russian technology transfer controls. BAE Systems and Lockheed Martin also contacted Podkletnov but he stated he would only work in the “white world” as he is anti-military. Boeing documents seen by Jane’s Defense Weekly admit “classified activities in gravity modification may exist.”

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **16 October 2002** — EarthTech International employee Dr. Eric Davis, author of several **AATIP** products years later, allegedly meets with VADM Thomas R. Wilson in a car outside of EG&G Special Projects in Las Vegas. Davis transcribes the interaction where he was told the following: VADM Wilson found records of a UAP reverse engineering program using technology “not of this Earth,” it was protected by a special agreement between the DOD Special Access Program Oversight Committee (SAPOC)’s Senior Review Group (SRG) and a large defense contractor he would not disclose.

Wilson states Gen. Michael Ward tells him to go to a special projects record group in OUSDAT files not belonging to usual SAP, but rather a group of special legacy holdover programs from before SAP restructuring efforts of the early 1990s. Wilson has this confirmed by OUSDAT officer Paul Kaminski, Director of SAPCO Brig. Gen. Mike Kostelnik and SecDef William J. Perry that the special records group exists and is UAP related. It is a special subset of waived carve-out SAPs obfuscated in the records by cover SAPs containing false descriptions. Wilson seemingly narrows down four UAP related SAPs and has these confirmed by Kaminski, Kostelnik and Perry, who tell him he has the correct contractor, only described as an undisclosed aerospace contractor, “one of the top ones in the US with intelligence in its portfolio.” Wilson states Perry wanted an investigation into cost overruns at the programs but was told to drop it by an undisclosed party.

Wilson next calls a program manager attached to the records group, who is joined by a security director and a corporate attorney, who are surprised when he discovered their program(s) are actually
UAP related (Wilson asks them about crashed UFOs and MJ-12). Wilson states they tell him they’re a “watch committee” of sorts, organized after an audit almost blew their cover, and a special agreement was struck between them, the auditor and SAPOC SRG to prevent disclosure in the future.

Wilson is invited to a facility, undisclosed, and meets the three individuals in a secure vault and is given a tour of the program He sees a bigot list 1990-1993 that has no Executive Branch, no staffers, no Clinton/Bush administrations, a few recognized names from OUSDAT, one from NSC and another Pentagon SES employee; most names were corporate scientists and engineers. Wilson is told it was not a weapons, intelligence or special ops program, it was a reverse engineering program from “something recovered years ago in the past,” technological hardware, an intact craft they believed could fly through space/water/air/dimensions. The PM next tells Wilson it is likely “not of this Earth, not made by human hands.” He is told the program had very slow progress and there was no collaboration.

Wilson next states he meets the SRG twice and asks for formal access to the four SAPs and is denied, and told by a leader in the SRG that if he doesn’t drop the matter, he will get early retirement and lose 1-2 stars. Wilson also states he talks to USDAT Jacques Gansler about the matter, who tells him UFOs are “real,” but alien abductions are not. Gansler also tells Wilson to drop the matter.

At the end of Davis’ and Wilson’s meeting, the contractor TRW is mentioned in relation to a Hughes Aircraft attorney Jeffrey W. Griffith and a client of his Mary Elizabeth Elliott. No additional context is given. Names not mentioned in the notes but are relevant include others involved in SAPOC or the SRG at the time: Noel Longuemare Jr., John P. White, John J. Hamre, William F. Moore, Richard “Dick” Williams and Gansler. Others involved in SAPOC who may be aware of the special agreement at the time of the SAP restructuring include John Deutch, Walter Slocombe, William A. Owens, Emmett Paige Jr., Lin Wells, John Ellis, Charles Bill Moore, Kostelnik and Kaminski.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **22 March 2003** — Stanford professor Peter Sturrock confides to Jacques Vallée that he believes Hal Puthoff’s work on zero point energy is full of “circular arguments.” Sturrock mentions Puthoff points to the significance of the ratio e/m but failed to see that he’s also redefining mass. Sturrock says he’s sent Bernard Haisch at Lockheed Martin six questions like that but Haisch never responded. Vallee says he fails to understand Puthoff’s argument as well.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **3 May 2003** — Kit Green tells Jacques Vallée that a rock from Socorro, NM that allegedly had traces of metal abrasions from the landing gear of a UFO was analyzed at NASA-Goddard as early as 1964. The metal consisted of zinc and iron in an unusual ratio. Green says the samples arrived in CIA possession in 1982 and re-analyzed at Los Alamos, to which it was concluded it was an
aluminum-titanium alloy not from Earth. In 1992, Green used resources at General Motors (while serving as executive director of materials research) to study the sample. Green’s work at GM corroborated the material was titanium and aluminum.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **7 May 2003** — Former Airman First Class Charles J Hall releases a book stating he worked at Nellis AFB between 1965 and 1967 and while there was observed by “tall whites,” entities who were taller than normal humans and presumed to be extraterrestrial in origin. Hall claims Nellis has a hangar entrance for deep space craft to the northwest of Dog Bone Lake and tunnel entrances to the northwest in Pintwater Range.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **11 June 2003** — NASA engineer Larry Lemke tells Lockheed scientist Bernard Haisch, as relayed to Jacques Vallée, that Lemke’s father worked on advanced hardware that “seemed to have come from beyond Earth.” Lemke and other unnamed sources tell Haisch that there are now four projects dealing with UAP matters, dispersed among USG contractor facilities.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **July 2003** — Civilian Dion Fuller claims he met “Lee” at an apartment complex in Pacific Beach, CA, after he had allegedly gone AWOL from nearby Camp Pendleton, stolen 25 pairs of night vision goggles, a pistol from Iraq, a DOD laptop and an entire truck; Fuller states Lee scrolled through allegedly classified files on the laptop in front of him marked TOP SECRET and soon after, Fuller claims three NCIS agents arrived and searched the premises, detained him for six days and threatened him before letting him go.

In the following months, Fuller claims he was followed by military-looking men with the following license plates: 4U49864 (white truck), 5DA726 (white sedan), 4WEP4HEP852 (brown Honda),
SE4JPL (white Toyota), 5BEA709 (Escape), 4EPW827 (black Acura), 809-E2G (Forerunner), 4AMP126 (white Toyota) and 4JPL825 (Xterra SE).

Fuller later meets Richard Schowengerdt, founder of **Project Chameleo**, who claims he has successfully developed a technique to make men invisible; his research is more advanced than work by “Tachi” or Duke University; Schowengerdt’s research has been used in the field of electromagnetics working at the Navy Metrology Engineering Center (MEC), the Naval Sea Systems Command Technical Representative Office (NAVSEA TECHREP AEGIS), and with the Naval Reserve at the Miramar Naval Air Station and the Naval Air Station in Pt. Mugu.

As of 2015, he worked with Northrop Grumman working on the EA-18G Growler; his private experiments with electro-optical camouflage began in 1987 and took shape in 1993 with **Project Chameleo**, securing Patent No. 5,307,162 “Cloaking Using Optoelectronically Controlled Camouflage” in 1994. Fuller believes SAIC may be responsible for harassment by seemingly invisible individuals and this may be connected to the “MiLAB '' phenomena, i.e. fake alien abductions.

Schowengerdt states the Chief of Naval Operations Strategic Studies Group visited him in 2005 to determine if his technology could be applied by the year 2025; during a presentation at a Military Sensing Symposium in Charleston, SC, he states he was giving a presentation for Army, Navy, Air Force and contractor personnel and halfway through, the moderator told him someone in the audience claimed he was revealing Top Secret information when he mentioned a “chameleonic” Future Soldier program; he states he wasn’t aware anything like that was operational; he was then detained by 3-4 personnel who made him prove the information was in the PUBLIC DOMAIN.

Schowengerdt states as of 2005 he worked with the Defense Contract Management Agency in El Segundo, and his supervisor knew of **Project Chameleo**; he states this technology not only can render a craft or a person invisible but it can project a rendering of something else like a tree or an animal for psychological warfare purposes; he states it’s possible this sort of technology could be advanced in a black project through reverse engineered UAP R&D; he also states he believes information about the UAP issue has been “leaked” in a controlled manner since the 1950s.

When Schowengerdt hears of Fuller’s claims of invisible harassment, he suggests SAIC “may have stolen \[his\] idea…I really do,” adding he had a meeting with an individual from SAIC in 1995-96; he states SAIC had come up with similar chameleonic cloaking technology in isolation; he states SAIC had a contract with the Army at that time; he adds he wouldn’t be surprised if the technology is being experimented covertly on Americans; he states he gave the Navy a tour of his lab and they were impressed but as of 2005 he did not have a contract with them.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **21 July 2003** — White House Army Signaling Agency specialist Stephen Lovekin states he received briefings concerning UAP while at Pentagon or at White House Com Center, states his colleagues discussed there were 3-5 “extraterrestrial” bodies recovered and one was alive; military was working with materials recovered including a metallic piece with symbols on it; states he
was at Camp David and Eisenhower was concerned about losing control to the military industrial complex, states he heard from others Einsenhower was being kept out of information regarding UAP later in his term.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **19 August 2003** — Jacques Vallée meets with Kit Green and Kristin B Zimmerman in Detroit, MI. While at Wayne State University, Green shows Vallee a study he conducted where test subjects who believed they had communication with aliens were shown a series of slides, including one in which a photo of an “alien face” is inserted. Green claims the image was from Los Alamos National Lab. He says he was given the data “through Hal” from a series of analyses done at LANL on “live aliens” from 1950-51. Green didn’t know if the photo was real but Zimmerman admits they may have been “fed” classified materials and Green used the materials to perform research on unsuspecting subjects. Green also conducts General Motors research here, where he is employed.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **23 August 2003** — Jacques Vallée writes that Hal Puthoff and John Petersen of the Arlington Institute “assure” him there is only one “black UFO operation” and that it likely has to do with hardware. Vallee is confused why there would be biological data in Kit’s hands and elsewhere if this were really the case. Vallee also states former DCI William Colby told Green he “deserve\[d\] to know,” but wouldn’t confirm alien biology outright.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **10 September 2003** — Bernard Haisch of Lockheed Martin states Hal Puthoff tried the “front door” approach to get into the secret UFO black program he believed existed. Puthoff wrote to a Pete Aldridge and Under Secretary Jacques Ganser but did not get a reply. Haisch believed the program was split into four parts and about 200 people were on the bigot lists. An unnamed individual “The General” was believed to still have access and was retired and working for an oil company when he met Puthoff at the suggestion of John Petersen.

That general is later revealed in a 18 September 2003 entry to be Jack Sheehan, now working for Bechtel in oil exploration. Sheehan states he saw and touched a “craft” but would not reveal more. Sheehan states he uncovered the UFO black project by discovering a $9B discrepancy.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **2 October 2003** — Hal Puthoff admits to Jacques Vallée in a car that he wouldn’t tell Vallee everything about the secret black UFO program to protect one critical “deep throat” and in case Vallee is ever polygraphed. Puthoff states that the ATP Group in the 1980s, sponsored by BDM Corp. and led by Col John Alexander, was killed because “there was already another project.” Puthoff states it was “deeply black” and “somebody” didn’t want it exposed or duplicated.

Puthoff also shows Vallee the VADM Thomas Wilson notes on this date and states they were written by Eric Davis. Puthoff says to “join” the project you have to have something major to contribute. “What are our chances? We don’t even know who the major contractor is,” he says. Vallee believes Wilson may be polygraphed at his next job as President of ATK Missiles because he may have leaked privileged information to Davis. Vallee also states he is told that the program was inside government but under Nixon it was transferred to a private contractor to secure it.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **March 2004** — Huntsville, AL company Transdimensional Technologies LLC states it is working on anti-gravitic technology for commercial applications and references UAP in a press release. Founder Jeff Cameron states the company is working with NASA and it is exploring transportation, military and space travel applications of its “Power Cubed” technology. The company obtains investment from local Huntsville businessmen Remigrius Shatas and Robert Asprey (founders of Cyber Corp., later Avocent), and additional investment from 2C Computing and local venture capital firm R&R Ventures, of which Asprey was also a partner. The company’s state filings are still active but its website is no longer online and it no longer provides updates to the public on its antigravity research. It was located at 906-E Bob Wallace Ave., Huntsville, AL 35801.

An archived version of the company’s website also shows it was developing a non-lethal weapon known as Medusa and a gravitational wave propulsion system. It suggests clients include military and NASA, and the Power Cubed propellantless propulsion rotor was developed on contract with NASA MSFC (H31066D).

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **June 2004** — Former Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban Development [Catherine Austin Fitts](https://home.solari.com/) writes in a paper that a “large proportion of the nation’s wealth is being illegally diverted…into secret, unaccountable channels” to support clandestine domestic military R&D. She claims that while at HUD, she came across evidence to suggest IT/accounting systems providers Lockheed Martin Information Systems, Dyncorp and AMS Inc. were responsible for the obfuscation and may have data on where missing DOD/HUD funds were siphoned to. Fitts also claims that complaints about AMS were answered by the Pentagon with its hire of IBM, but IBM in turn, subcontracted AMS, Lockheed, Dyncorp, SAIC and Accenture to manage the systems that failed a GAO audit.

Fitts also claims AMS violated fiduciary and control practices by “installing its own equipment and software with no parallel runs against the legacy software and accounting system.” AMS was hired by HUD in 1996 to manage internal accounting and financial controls and Fitts claims while she was at HUD, AMS’s actions led to $76 billion in undocumentable transactions.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **August 2004** — Alleged US Army/DIA official John Maynard states Atlantic Research Corporation is deeply involved in the UAP matter. TRW, Johnson Controls and Honeywell are mentioned as well that allegedly receive money to work on highly compartmentalized waived unacknowledged Special Access Programs where only four people knew what was happening. Maynard claims some UAP information is controlled by three families: the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds and the Hapsburgs. CSETI (see 13 February 2009) was partially funded by Laurance Rockefeller.

>**_Note_**: To more deeply probe the connections between wealthy entrepreneurial families and funding of possibly rogue UAP projects, one would want to look at linkages between: (1) all members of those families, (2) all front companies linked to those families and (3) all meetings held by those families and the aerospace world. If intermediary funding mechanisms are used one would also want to look for linkages between those families and organizations that may fund aerospace related projects. See possible example: the Lindbergh Foundation (see 3 December 1999).

>**_Note_**: USAF Project Outgrowth (see June 1972) referenced Atlantic Research Corporation. Outgrowth’s lead Franklin Mead studied advanced propulsion concepts for decades at Edwards AFB and it is curious to see Atlantic referenced there, given Maynard’s claims it was involved in UAP work. Other companies referenced alongside Atlantic in Outgrowth at the time were Armour Research Foundation, IIT Research Institute, United Aircraft Research Laboratory, Chrysler Corporation, Lockheed Missiles and Space Company, Aerojet General Corporation, Physics International Company and Pratt and Whitney.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **7 August 2004** — Former NIDS contractor Jim Westwood tells Jacques Vallée that Charles Bowsher, former Comptroller General under President Reagan, states he found a “crashed UFO program” during a large audit of classified programs. Bowsher uncovered it in 1984-85, which he called a “bizarre special access program coverup which surely violated every classification, executive order, regulation, and Congressional rule.” Bowsher considered turning it over to the Department of Justice for prosecution, but an unnamed powerful individual in the DOD squashed it. Bowsher said the program had to do with an “exotic, non-Earthly vehicle.”

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **2004** — Ufologist Bill Cooper claims underground bases under control of Naval Intelligence utilize cooperation between aliens and humans in Utah, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and Nevada. Cooper claims some are built beneath Native American reservations for cover, something the research of Danny Casolaro into Wackenhut also seems to suggest (see 1 August 1993).

Cooper also claims a secret fund was organized and kept by the Military Office of the White House in the 1950s, specifically the White House Underground Construction Fund by President Eisenhower, that assisted the building of underground military bases for human-alien collaboration and for general operations of a UAP control group “MJ-12.” Cooper claims Rep. George Mahon, Rep. Robert Sikes and Rep. Jim Wright knew of the effort.

Cooper also claims money was transferred from the top-secret fund to a location at Palm Beach, FL belonging to the Coast Guard called Peanut Island, a property near a facility owned by Joseph Kennedy. Cooper also claims Eisenhower set up Majority Twelve through NSC 5410 as cover, its names having changed to the Special Group under Kennedy, the 40 Committee under Nixon, Ford and Carter, and the PI-40 Committee under Reagan. Alleged Study Group members include Gordon Dean, Zbigniew Brzezinksi, Henry Kissinger and 34 others, and meetings were allegedly held at Marine Base Quantico, VA where the group was known as “Quantico II.” The meetings were held using the code name “The Country Club.”

Cooper claims these meetings led to the creation of **Project Joshua** and **Project Excalibur**, and that Rand Corporation was involved in the construction of underground facilities, and that the illegal drug trade using smuggling operations from Zapata Oil assisted in funding.

One night during that week, the flight line was evacuated, the base was locked down and USAF personnel were advised to stay inside and away from the windows to protect an incoming classified aircraft.

Walker states despite listening for it, over the next half-hour, he heard no tires hitting the pavement, no brakes, no engine, no idling or anything. After 30 minutes they were cleared to go back outside after the aircraft landed, but they saw no signs of anything that happened. Walker states he experienced something similar at Dyess Air Force Base in Abilene, Texas. He does not speculate on what the aircrafts were, but states other personnel he has spoken to share similar experiences that are “brushes with black projects,” some bordering on myth and “utter absurdity.”

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **2005** — Kit Green states he returned to private medicine and began working on a research project that involved compiling a database of individuals suffering injuries, burns, skin lesions, cancer and diseases after cat to face encounters with UAP. Green’s 100+ patients were military personnel or from aerospace industries, their own doctors were clueless; Green based his hypothesis on patients being exposed to some form of black ops technology such as non lethal weaponry, holographs, cloaking technology, drones, etc.

Green said within 5-7 years, 25% of his patients died and he had no idea what kind of technology could do this. Green was CMO of Enscion Corporation around this time, a company that used genetic information to analyze chronic conditions. A publicly available document states Green conducted tests at WPAFB Medical Center and analyzed UBOs (unidentified bright objects) present in MRI scans.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **1 November 2005** — Victor Martinez, a civilian who runs an internet message board for retired intelligence community people interested in UAP, receives what alleges to be a
3,000-page report compiled by the Defense Intelligence Agency in the 1970s classified Top Secret.

It claims: there were two UAP crash sites in New Mexico southwest of Corona and at Pelona Peak, one live entity was found and several dead were transferred to Los Alamos National Laboratory, while the craft was sent to Wright-Patterson AFB. The live entity allegedly helped USG establish communications with his home planet, “Serpo,” in which 12 trained Americans eventually went to “Serpo” from the Nevada Test Site.

A few months later, an anonymous UK Ministry of Defense official nicknamed “Chapman” claimed the document is real, describing fake events. Chapman claims he saw the document in 1969-70 and claims it was written by CIA officer Alice Bradley Sheldon under the pseudonym James Tiptree Jr. Chapman claims the CIA wrote it in response to Soviet disinformation.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **October 2006** — Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory physicist “Henry Deacon” (pseudonym) claims he is employed by a three-letter agency and that black budget physics is decades ahead of physics in the open source. Deacon claims **Project Shiva Nova** uses arrays of lasers and creates rips in the fabric of space-time; Deacon claims this lets “things” like beings, influences and “all kinds of weird stuff” come into our present reality.

Deacon claims USG knowledge of probable and possible futures is highly classified and attempts to meddle in space-time creates more issues; time loops, rips, etc. Deacon claims UAP occupants on Earth are time travelers, and that experiments at Montauk, NY were real, but that claims by Al Bielek and others may be disinformation or incorrect. Deacon states Montauk was a “real mess…they created a time split we’re still unable to mend…this also relates to **Project Rainbow**.” Deacon claims jump rooms exist and that they’re naturally occurring and a stable one exists between locations on Earth and Mars.

Deacon corroborates testimony by Dan Burisch, who claims ET groups are concerned about affecting Earth’s current timeline for different outcomes they are interested in. Deacon claims **Project Looking Glass** may have been real and utilizes time viewing technology given to USG by ET. Deacon claims some ET groups are our own ancestors from different futures and nuclear weapons testing and high energy physics testing has created “time loops upon time loops, it’s all a mess.”

Deacon states there are a number of parallel timelines, lots of branches; and to the USG knowledge, there are no paradoxes. If the past is changed, it creates a different timeline, a new branch of the original one.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **2008** — Dan Burisch claims to have been a microbiologist working at Papoose Lake Facility/S4 and claims to have been involved in a **Project Aquarius** investigating an extraterrestrial entity “J-Rod” and its neuropathy. Burisch claims he was a pro-tem member of Majestic-12, MJ-9, and dealt with “extraterrestrial human lineage and time travel information.”

He claims **Project Looking Glass** involved a reverse engineered time viewing device, and that there were three extraterrestrial groups visiting Earth: the P45s, humans from approximately 45,000 years in the future that were pale and “grey alien” in appearance, having lived in an apocalyptic Earth; the P52s
from 52,000 years in the future of similar appearance and the P52 Orions, who are human looking and spiritual. Burisch claims the P45s and P52 stayed on Earth after a catastrophe and the P52 Orions left Earth for the Moon and later Mars. Burisch claims the P45s are intent on justifying their history and want the catastrophe to occur, while the P52s and P52 Orions do not. Burisch also claims a **Project Lotus** is attempting to utilize ET technology to manipulate human DNA and RNA.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **June 2008** — DARPA PE 0603286E is disclosed in the PUBLIC DOMAIN for the first time and contains several sub-projects, including Advanced Aerospace System Concepts or “**Project AIR-01**.” AASC is described as a program to examine and evaluate emerging aerospace technologies for military use and emerging aerospace threats and methods to counter them. The program continued to be funded until at least 2020, where it was mentioned in a budget document.

The language in the AASC program description is similar to the DIA’s Advanced Aerospace Weapons Systems Application Program (**AAWSAP**), and coincidentally received DARPA funding the same year the DIA sought private sector bids for **AAWSAP**.

For example, AEC security patrol archives in Oak Ridge, TN contained a sighting of a rectangular UAP on 20 June 1949. It stands to reason other local archives may contain more up to date data.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **4 August 2008** — An anonymous poster on Above Top Secret claims a family friend was a senior Naval officer when he was growing up and he told him there is a “mountain of BS” out there regarding Montauk and Camp Hero and the primary aspect of the facility was the utilization of drugs to test subjects’ psi capabilities. He states there were rooms that were designed in a way to trigger bad trips when the subjects were on LSD because there was a belief that trauma could improve a user’s psi abilities. Of note, **Operation Midnight Climax**, a subproject of **Project MK-ULTRA** based on lessons learned in **Project Artichoke**, was a real declassified CIA program that drugged unknowing citizens with LSD to study the effects.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **October 2008** — JASON Group’s Program Office, run out of the MITRE Corp., publishes a technical report evaluating the national security significance of high frequency gravitational waves (HFGW). The report concludes national security and aerospace applications of HFGW are not possible and wrong. Two years later, HFGW was the subject of a Defense Intelligence Reference Document produced for the Defense Intelligence Agency’s Advanced Aerospace Weapon Systems Applications Program (**AAWSAP**), which concluded HFGW could be used for interplanetary navigation. It is unknown but likely HFGW was deemed UAP-affiliated subject matter due to its inclusion in the **AAWSAP** program.

It is possible JASON was tasked to debunk HFGW because the responsible party listed on the SF298 for MITRE’s contract was Dr. Ronald Pandolfi, of CIA. Ten years later (see 26 February 2019),
Pandolfi was sued by FOX TV producer Robert Kiviat for allegedly running a disinformation scheme to frame public perception of the UAP issue.

A response to the JASON paper from the author of the **AAWSAP** paper, Robert Baker of GravWave LLC, accuses the JASON analysis of making several serious errors including a failure to review all available peer-reviewed literature. When asked if JASON had a “preconceived agenda to discredit HFGW research,” Baker and GravWave responded: “it is difficult to believe otherwise.”

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **17 October 2008** — The Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) forms the MUFON Advanced Technology Establishment (MATE) composed of Bob Wood, Charles Modlin, Robert Powell and Chuck Reever. MATE signs a contract with Bigelow Aerospace Advanced Space Studies (**BAASS**) to provide **BAASS** with technical papers on the subjects of UAP lift, power generation, human interface, alleged extraterrestrial implants, abductions, antigravity propulsion and using superconductors for propulsion.

Soon after, **BAASS** served as a contractor for the Pentagon’s Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications Program (**AAWSAP**), but it is unknown of the MATE studies on implants, etc. made its way into the hands of USG program managers at **AAWSAP**. It is also unknown if **BAASS** disclosed to MATE that they were a contractor for the USG.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **8 May 2009** — A Department of Homeland Security black sedan visits a UAP witness twice after a sighting in Georgia. The witness “Derek Jones” sees a large triangular UAP and four smaller spherical UAP above his backyard. When “Jones” attempts to photograph it, the device fails. When he points a flashlight at the triangle, it responds with a beam of blue-white light on him for 3 seconds, causing burning and later, hair loss and lumps on his legs, groin and back diagnosed as
non-malignant lymphoma. The same day the DHS personnel first interview “Jones,” he hears low-flying helicopters near his property. One of the men is armed and they produce no identification.

They tell him not to mention the sighting to anyone, and take detailed notes and diagrams of Jones’ description of the triangle. “Jones” reported the license plate to Bigelow Aerospace Advanced Space Studies (**BAASS**), a contractor for the Defense Intelligence Agency’s Advanced Aerospace Weapon Systems Applications Program (**AAWSAP**). **BAASS** tracks the license plate to a DHS carpool.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **January 2010** — U.S. Navy Petty Officer John Baughman sees a “Tic-Tac” shaped object from the flight deck of the USS Carl Vinson near Haiti. It was barely beneath the surface when he saw it, white and 20 feet in length, and quickly “darted” into the depths. “It was definitely a solid object, but when it descended, its forward end rapidly collapsed in on itself and disappeared.” Baughman told his work center supervisor about the UAP, to which he was not debriefed and was not told
to file a report. The supervisor told him “everyone sees weird shit in the ocean.” The event likely did not make its way into Navy or **UAPTF** reporting channels or Congress prior to it being disclosed to a journalist in 2021.

Advanced Aerospace Weapon Systems Applications Program (**AAWSAP**), claims to meet former AFOSI Col. Barry Hennessey. Hennessey tells Grossman AFOSI could not identify many nuclear base UAP overflights from the 1975 wave.

Hennessey believes many AFOSI records for those cases were destroyed and suggested some UAP that flew over nuclear bases and interfered with launch controls were secret USG/USG contractor aircraft. In December 2010, **BAASS** directors James T. Lacatski, Colm Kelleher and Larry Grossman met the director of operations for the Office of Special Projects of AFOSI, Jack Angelo, at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **February 2011** — On 7 February 2011 Bigelow Aerospace Advanced Space Studies (**BAASS**) director James T. Lacatski, a contractor for the Defense Intelligence Agency’s Advanced Aerospace Weapon Systems Applications Program (**AAWSAP**), allegedly visited the Washington, D.C. headquarters of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to secure funding for future fiscal years. Lacatski allegedly met DHS’s Jim Bell and Sacha Mover in a SCIF and briefed them on the program.

Some time later that month or next, a second meeting was held with Bell, Mover and DHS Under Secretary for Science and Technology Tara O’Toole, to which Mover told them the following story: his family members in rural Kentucky told him in 2007, a large group of them saw a low flying large UAP that hovered before moving off in “impossible” velocity. Within 24 hours, three large black SUVs pulled into the area, wearing black suits and dark glasses, Mover stated. The men told the crowd “you would be well advised not to talk about this incident in the future…it will be in your interests not to speak about this incident again” in a threatening tone. Three months later, the rural Kentucky community was mysteriously equipped with state of the art electrical transformers that upgraded the infrastructure of the town. Mover told **BAASS** to look into the event.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **31 March 2011** — Author Nick Redfern states he calls a representative of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska. The representative tells him he can meet with the “Collins Elite,” a group of current and former intelligence community personnel who believe UAP are demonic in origin. The Collins Elite allegedly believes all UAP are demonic and should not be contacted. Redfern was given this information by a “Richard Duke” and was given “the Collins Report,” which is allegedly a briefing document from the 1980s that lays out the group’s theories.

Duke claims the group established the belief that UAP are interdimensional and demonic when the FBI, AFOSI and other agencies began investigating physicist Jack Parsons for his links to Aleister Crowley and L. Ron Hubbard, and Parsons’ allegiance to the United States. Parsons was a principal founder of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Aerojet Engineering Corporation, and led the California branch of the Thelemite Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO) in the 1940s.

Duke claims some in the US IC believed Parsons and his occult practices were responsible for some UAP sightings, alleging occult rituals were responsible for the channeling of specific UAP events or the “opening” of entry points where more UAP would enter afterward. Duke also claims early members of the Collins Elite were asked by some in the CIA Directorate of Plans in 1952 to determine if UAP had demonic origin. Some **Project Blue Book** cases at the time reminded some CIA officials of ghosts, demons, etc. Duke claims members eventually included AFOSI, NSA and CIA, and other agencies.

Redfern states Duke and other sources informed him that CIA and Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) personnel attempted to contact entities “Affa” and “Ponnar,” but those attempts allegedly failed. Officials were concerned with eschatalogical forecasts discussed in occult circles, but the forecasts never came to fruition. Duke also claims in the late 1960s, the work of Sidney Gottleib in the Technical Services Staff (CIA TSS) and work by Donald Ewen Cameron was taken up by scientists attached to the CIA’s Office of Research and Development, who attempted to harness “demonic powers” for espionage purposes under **Operation Often**.

Duke claims **Operation Often** and Collins Elite personnel used a cover story that they were US Army psychologists working on a project for the University of South Carolina to understand mental trauma in military personnel; the group’s actual goal was to analyze the nightmares of Paul Garratt after a near-death experience. Garratt told Often personnel after seeing a tunnel of bright light, he was taken to a colder place that was never-ending, flat, light blue and filled with naked screaming human beings; above them were hundreds of saucer-like UAP that “pulsed and throbbed” as if they were living and breathing. Garratt claimed he was in turmoil watching this and saw small “balls of light” fly from the bodies of the people into the saucers. Often personnel concluded the NDE suggested saucers might be harvesting human souls and they were demonic in nature.

Duke claims in the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan was briefed on UAP from different perspectives, including the Collins Elite on the demonic UAP theory, the CIA Science and Technology division on the extraterrestrial/genetic agenda theory, and an Air Force psychologist who argued abductions were not real and the result of the human subconscious. Reagan gravitated to the Collins Elite explanation, and funded a deeper investigation into the phenomenon that concluded abductions were a demonic deception.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **26 March 2011** — Ufologist Chuck Wade presents information at the 14th Annual Aztec UFO Symposium allegedly from different military sources related to UAP crash recoveries. Wade states there were at least seven UAP crash recovery sites in New Mexico between 1945 and 1948:

*   Avocado-shaped craft at San Antonio, NM, August 1945
*   32’ craft on the Plains of San Augustin, NM, 1-2 July 1947
*   25’ oval craft SW of Roswell, 4 July 1947
*   12’ to 15’ craft NW of Roswell, 4 July 1947
*   Large debris field requiring recovery 40 mi. SW of Corona, NM
*   20’ in craft in the foothills of the Capitan Mountains 50 mi. W of Roswell
*   100’ craft in Hart Canyon 9 mi. N of Aztec, NM.

Wade claims high powered radar units accidentally or purposefully may have interfered with some of the alleged UAP, facilities he claims were located at El Vado, Gallup and Moriarty.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **June-July 2011** — DHS officials Jim Bell and Sacha Mover begin a series of other meetings in the U.S. intelligence community beyond DHS to determine if they can set up **BAASS** as a UAP analysis program within DHS Science & Technology (S&T). Those met are the “keepers of the secrets,” who treat Bell and Mover rudely and told “no, and hell no” when asked. Bell and Mover later told **BAASS** that they believed advanced technology was being held at aerospace contractor facilities under government supervision. Mover and Bell became fearful of moving forward. By late 2011, DHS Deputy Secretary Jane Holl Lute, Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis Phyllis Green, and others decided not to contract **BAASS** within DHS.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **July 2012** — Bernard Mendez alleges he attended a “jump room” school with Andrew Basiago, William Stillings, and former DARPA director Regina Dugan in the early 1980s. He alleged the class was taught by Maj. Ed Dames who participated in **Project Star Gate’s** various iterations, something Dames promptly denied.

Mendez claims the teleportation technology was transferred from a species of Grey extraterrestrials to the USG, and that the jump rooms were not actually visiting real destinations, but “folds” in spacetime created by the Greys known as “slots.” These “slots” are allegedly simulations of various destinations, also known as synthetic quantum environments (SQEs); Basiago claims the Greys built SQEs to help humanity understand the interdimensional multiverse.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **8 July 2012** — Alleged former USAF Sgt. Daniel Brad MacBolen III claims to have participated in a SAP having to do with “jump room” technology. He claims jump rooms do not actually travel to other destinations in our physical reality but that humans are being misled, and they’re traveling to synthetic quantum environments (SQE). MacBolen speaks of a segment of ET known as “the Verdant,” who might wish to keep humans blind to the nature of 5D reality and keep humans in their current 3D reality.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **2012** — Author Bryce Zabel tells a story told to him by Brent Friedman, the alleged neighbor of former Secretary of Energy John S. Herrington (under the Reagan administration). Herrington allegedly stated he had been briefed for several weeks at an underground facility outside of Washington, D.C. and the information learned caused him to “cry himself to sleep for a number of nights.” When asked why, Herrington allegedly stated “there is intelligent life in the universe; it’s here and I’ve seen it; this is not the kind of world I thought \[my children\] would grow up in.”

Herrington also allegedly stated the existence of extraterrestrials were the “tip of the iceberg” in terms of the revelations he learned related to the issue.

Over the next 30 years, Uhouse claims he worked for defense contractors as a pilot in a “flying disc simulator” and in actual flying discs. Uhouse states in 1962-63 the simulator became operational and was based on a recovered disc landing from Kingman, AZ from 1952-53. Uhouse states the craft was “presented” to the USG.

Uhouse states the craft was taken to Area 51 early in its construction and four “alien” occupants went to Los Alamos upon delivery of the craft to A51. He also states the ET assisted human physicists and engineers in reverse engineering efforts.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **December 2014** — A documentary is released that interviews aerospace illustrator Mark McCandlish, who claims a friend of his, Bradford Sorensen, saw a man-made disc-shaped craft at Norton Air Force Base in 1988. Brad states the first generation Aurora was also at the airshow in a hangar, and states he accidentally got access to a section of a hangar reserved for a private showing that displayed a “Fluxliner,” aka an Alien Reproduction Vehicle (ARV). He states there were “three” flying saucers that looked like “something from the 1950s.” Brad gave McCandlish all of the details of what he saw, of which McCandlish made drawings of them. There was a small, medium and large sized ARV that were “hovering” above the floor of the hangar. A three star general presented a film of an ARV “hopping” over a desert scene before taking off vertically quickly; the general also allegedly said the ARVs were capable of light speed or better.

Lt. Col. John Williams also states while at Norton AFB he heard rumors that one facility that was “close hold” that contained one “UFO craft.” Williams states it was a location where people could come to Norton and see the craft. McCandlish also states Hal Puthoff explained to him how zero point energy could be used to propel a craft; it is unknown if Puthoff believed a craft was stored at Norton.

McCandlish also states he was threatened on the phone for talking about the ARV and states he was the subject of an IRS audit. He states much of the technology could be overlooked/exempt from FOIA because it’s held in private industry.

The film also states “free energy” researchers Stefan Marinov in Austria fell out of a window in 1997, cold fusion expert Eugene Mallove died of blunt force trauma in 2004 before a presentation, zero point energy physicist Arie deGeus died in a parked car in 2007 before a trip to secure funding, zero point energy Stardrive patent Mark Tomion died unexpectedly in 2009 after corresponding with McCandlish.

McCandlish was reported to be found dead of suspicious circumstances in 2021.

The filmmaker who created this movie, James Allen, died of heavy metal poisoning three months after the film finished editing.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **30 January 2015** — Retired US Navy Petty Officer First Class flight Engineer “Brian” tells ufologist Linda Moulton Howe he saw a large hole to an underground facility 5-10 miles from the geographic South Pole; he states the area was supposed to be a no fly zone but during an emergency medevac, they flew through the area. He also states at a camp near Marie Byrd Land, 10-15 scientists “disappeared for two weeks” on assignment and when they re-appeared “their faces looked scared,” and he claims he saw silver UAP near the Transantarctic Mountain range in 1995-96 while he was flying on assignment. After seeing the hole in the ice, an “intelligence-gathering” type of individual sat his crew down and told them “OK, you guys saw this thing, but you did not see it.”

Eighteen months after sharing his story, “Brian” claims he received an anonymous phone call that told him not to talk about the missing scientists and “certain people” would prefer that he not talk about it. The phone number was not blocked; he searched it after the call and it came up as a number associated with the NSA in Fort Meade, MD, he claims.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **6 March 2015** — Former USG contractor Bob Fish tells Clinton campaign manager John Podesta that the USAF **Defense Support Program (DSP)** collects “hard data” on UAP. Fish states he had lunch with a few members in a highly classified TS/SCI organization in El Segundo, CA. One time, he overheard a member say they “picked up a Fastwalker,” how it entered Earth's atmosphere from deep space and traveled past a DSP satellite. Fish names The Aerospace Corporation in his email.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **6 March 2015** — Former USG contractor Bob Fish tells Clinton campaign manager John Podesta that in a TS/SCI organization in El Segundo, CA, he had lunch with a senior USAF NCO who worked for **Project Blue Book** in the 1970s after it had publicly disbanded. He was an ELINT technician who flew in RC-135s from MacDill AFB in Florida. He allegedly told Fish they were sometimes diverted to track UAP off the east coast of Florida; the UAP allegedly came from a hotspot east of Miami, north of Bermuda. A specific frequency emanated from them, and UAP evidence was sent to a “dedicated” USAF intelligence officer.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **13 March 2015** — Kit Green states the records of Ret. USAF John Burroughs, Rendlesham Forest incident witness, were legally classified by the DOD. Green states only a handful of medical records were classified and the reasons were because inside the doctors notes, nursing, etc. are a “myriad of references to Special Access Projects” and the names of other adjacent and ancillary programs and projects that can not be disentangled and could uncover active/recent projects related to Rendlesham. Green states broadband non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation caused the injuries, the data is sparse and it is not well understood or peer reviewed.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **5 November 2015** — The National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) states in response to a FOIA request that it has no documentation related to UFOs. It states the topic is “outside of the scope of NRO responsibilities; furthermore, the NRO has conducted numerous searches…in the past, and has located no records.” This contradicts emails released by the NRO on 8 April 2022, which show extensive coordination with the DOD’s **Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force** (**UAPTF**), and states the NRO contributed to the **UAPTF** report to Congress “tied to its collection efforts.” This implies UAP are being detected on NRO platforms, and suggests the FOIA response in 2015 wasn’t accurate if they were being detected in 2015 or before.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **December 2015** — BAE Systems engineer Ronald Evans discloses the existence of Project Greenglow, described as a small research project in the UK to investigate the control of gravity for aerospace applications. It is reported BAE had no success in their experiments, but Evans’ review of the small project is not comprehensive of all of the company’s efforts in antigravity.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **24 January 2016** — USAF Maj. Gen. Neil McCasland, USAF Maj. Gen. Michael Carey, Lockheed Martin Skunk Works EVP Rob Weiss, Hillary Clinton campaign manager John Podesta and Clinton campaign assistant Milia Fisher met virtually with musician Tom DeLonge to discuss UAP. Details of the meeting are not released, but afterward, DeLonge claimed he had a team of
“high-ranking advisors” helping him prepare the U.S. public through media for USG disclosure of UAP information.

DeLonge wrote to Podesta that McCasland, who led the Air Force Research Laboratory at
Wright-Patterson AFB, told him “when Roswell crashed, they shipped it to \[WPAFB\]...he not only knows what I’m trying to achieve \[USG disclosure\], he helped me assemble my advisory team.”

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **5 March 2016** — National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) spokesman Darwin Morgan divulges the Nevada National Security Site’s Area 6 activities for the first time publicly. Morgan states top secret R&D work is done there, primarily sensor testing and unmanned aerial vehicle testing for partners at Air Force, Army, Navy, Marines, DTRA and DARPA. The only other public mention of Area 6 is in a 7,500-page safety report on the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste project describing it as an “aerial operations facility.” It is possible the NNSA has relevant UAP information that it has not reported to centralized bodies like the **UAPTF**.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **27 March 2016** — Tom DeLonge states in early 2016 that he was told by his CIA “advisors” that when UAP crashes happen, intelligence, military and private industry was pooled together. “They’ve” been using private companies/publicly traded companies to keep the secret information “protected” through organizations that are non-governmental.

DeLonge states he has been told how public perception on UAP has been shaped by private interests and his “advisors” review his publicly disseminated information. DeLonge also states he met
with the CIA (2015?). DeLonge also states the MJ-12 documents are not accurate and in reality, things are more fragmented; it’s a “very, very small group” of people at the top putting it all together and pulling in what data they’re able to get from other areas of IC/private industry. DeLonge states he was told “the Others” are manipulating countries against the US/West hegemony.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **April 2016** — Tom DeLonge states he was told by unnamed “advisors” that there were multiple UAP crashes and recoveries. The USG and its contractors hid it, created a “pickup game” of counter intelligence, DeLonge claims, and adds that it was at one time bigger than the Manhattan Project. He states it is currently held by a private corporation where “certain laws” protect their own breakthroughs and proprietary assets; DeLonge adds that he asked the advisors if the crash recovery program(s) were legal, or if they were illegal. He claims the advisors showed him an “exact law,” with an exact paragraph and number on a “government website” to justify what they were doing as legal.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **5 April 2016** — Sekret Machines: Book 1, Chasing Shadows is released by authors Tom DeLonge and AJ Hartley. DeLonge claims his “advisors” from the US intelligence community and Executive Branch helped him shape the information in it and it is fiction with concepts that are true. The main tenets of Sekret Machines are as follows:

*   Dreamland/Area 51 has a man-made flying saucer
*   The UAP R&D work at Area 51 is entirely a subdivision of a major aerospace contractor within a location called “Possum Plant”
*   Area 51 had a triangle Astra-TR3B called “the Locust” that exploits curvature in spacetime
*   S4 near Area 51 had a simulator for the Locust
*   A fictional “Maynard Corporation” was laundering money through an entity called “SWEEP,” a network of funding streams tied to aerospace concerns around the world dedicated to R&D and operation
*   SWEEP includes the fraudulent tagging of private land as hosts to endangered species so it can be utilized for R&D purposes
*   A breakaway group exists with a large amount of money and no national allegiance that maintains total control over the disparate projects
*   Russia has their own back engineered craft and operates it on behalf of someone else
*   The US operation for reverse engineered UAP craft is “beyond black”
*   The enforcement of SWEEP utilizes personnel who pose as government agents including for the EPA
*   “Alien” abductions are faked to psychologically traumatize witnesses of black projects and cover the human element
*   A disc was held at an old Creech AFB underground hangar away from S4
*   A human piloted saucer engaged an ET piloted sphere and shot it down
*   Military officials involved in the projects believe ET were interpreted as “Greek gods” in ancient history

Former CIA official Jim Semivan states he and colleagues were concerned this book was written after a leak of classified information because “it had some very interesting data in it.” Semivan later says he realized there was no leak, DeLonge just “put two and two together.”

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **18 April 2016** — Steven Greer says he had a source at Blackjack Control and Blackjack Team was at Nellis; Tejon Ranch, Llano Plant, Helendale Plant, Phillips Labs are all underground, a newer facility called “The Cube” past Lancaster in Edwards airspace, which is a Lockheed Martin Skunk Works facility; Lockheed and Northrop have multiple generations of craft that resemble UAP; LANL has underground connector to Dulce complex; Fort Huachuca has a storage facility that had “nine” ET spacecraft that were downed using pulsed scalar weapons as of the 1970s; “the most critical one” that’s new is an underground complex southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah under Dugway Proving Grounds; he says “Mormon Corporate Empire” has greater say on UAP policy than President or Congress.

Greer adds that all military intelligence divisions have compartments that feed into MAJIC committee, FBI has some compartments; Bechtel does “underground base construction” and EG&G has key facility for creating nanotechnology implants put into abduction victims. He also claims MITRE is key in antigravity and SAIC is a “crown jewel” that had crossover between Bobby Ray Inman in SAIC and MAJIC; and Wackenhut does security for MAJIC.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **22 March 2017** — DOE’s National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) publicly discloses its partnership with NASA for planetary defense. Both agencies work with FEMA to determine potentially hazardous near-Earth objects and prepare for them. NNSA’s three national security laboratories, Sandia, Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore, assist. NNSA’s Office of Defense Programs (DP) sponsors technical research. It is possible the NNSA has relevant UAP information that it has not reported to centralized bodies like the **UAPTF**.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **27 March 2017** — Anonymous website partially encoded publishes an article on “turning the vehicle into a pilot’s prosthetic extension.” In the article are vague examples of how to replicate the piloting features of a UAP: “there must be no difference between the aircraft and the crew…you cannot just take a human being and fit him with all this array of sensors; you first need to tweak the human somehow to better exploit the capabilities of this technology…we need to go a step further from the current paradigm of manned aircrafts and shift toward a paradigm of aircrafts that behave like a human.” Elsewhere on the site, allegedly non-public reports from Raytheon and Lockheed are cited.

Another article from 20 December 2017 writes that USAF pilots are trained to be aware of UAP, shares a seemingly non-public FLIR image dated 11 November 2014 and states: “we want our enemies to believe in UFOs up to the point it becomes too late for them to react to an airstrike by our own air force; we also need our pilots not to believe in UFOs should the enemy use this same strategy against us.”

It also states that **Corona East**, **Akrij** and **Sienna** are three PSV craft in operation that deploy “MilOrbs” and they perform covert test unbeknownst to USG knowledge to see how crew react to them.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **April 2017** — USAF Maj. Brain Hans, Maj. Christopher Jefferson and Maj. Joshua Wehrle of the Curtis LeMay Center for Doctrine Development and Education at Maxwell AFB publish a framework to “leverage advanced propulsion” for deep space travel. Specifically the framework cites the work of James Woodward (see June 2001) of Cal State and Paul March of Lockheed Martin Space Operations using lead zirconate titanate (PZT), a piezoelectric compound, to achieve mass reduction for aerospace applications.

The framework states laboratory experiments confirm the findings that PZT can achieve flight and could enable missions with no limitations experienced by conventional propulsion systems. The USAF authors also state the Aerospace Corporation concluded this research didn’t warrant government funding, but they disagree with that conclusion. They also mention EmDrive as another breakthrough propulsion technology opportunity that could “revolutionize” how USAF operates in deep space. They conclude more metamaterials are needed to continue this work and optimize aerospace mass education effects.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **26 October 2017** — Musician Tom DeLonge suggests on a podcast he is being advised by USAF Maj. Gen. Neil McCasland, USAF Maj. Gen. Michael Carey, Lockheed Martin Skunk Works EVP Rob Weiss, Hillary Clinton campaign manager John Podesta, Dr. Hal Puthoff, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Christopher K. Mellon and former OUSD(I) employee and **AATIP** head Luis Elizondo, among others unnamed, to carry out slow disclosure of UAP information to the American public from USG/USG contractor sources.

DeLonge claims USG/USG contractors already have free energy technology, i.e. zero-point energy, that would make all other forms of energy derivation obsolete. “One inch of air could power the
US for hundreds of years,” he claimed. DeLonge suggested his group, To The Stars Academy of Arts & Science (TTSA), was being restrained from releasing all information government insiders were telling him, but that TTSA sought investment from private investors to develop said free energy technology for energy and aerospace purposes. DeLonge also stated TTSA expected to create a working anti-gravity craft; the company’s offering statement to the SEC stated the company’s aerospace division was “dedicated to finding revolutionary breakthroughs in propulsion, energy and communications.”

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **2 November 2017** — Salvatore Pais of the Naval Air Station Patuxent River files a patent for a triangle/diamond shaped craft that has anti-gravitic effects and resembles some UAP sightings. The patent was initially rejected but Naval Aviation Enterprise CTO James Sheehy filed for appeal to the USPTO and stated “it will become a reality” and China was already investing in it. The patent was then approved. The technology described in Pais’ patent is similar to that of Hal Puthoff’s **AATIP** DIRD on vacuum engineering. Pais’ patent describes a craft that is able to manipulate quantum vacuum fluctuations around the craft for propulsion purposes.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **11 December 2017** — Former Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban Development [Catherine Austin Fitts](https://home.solari.com/) publishes a paper with a Michigan State University economist that finds $21 trillion in unauthorized spending in the departments of Defense and Housing and Urban Development between 1998 and 2015. A university press release states the DODIG disabled key documents showing unsupported spending after the paper was published, and soon after, the DOD announced its first ever department-wide independent audit in its history. Fitts believes some of the unauthorized funding was for domestic “clandestine military R&D,” some of which was UAP related and diverted from DOD/HUD to illegal programs.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **2018** — Former Lockheed Martin astrophysicist Bernard Haisch, a colleague of Eric Davis and Hal Puthoff, comments on four alleged “legacy” UAP programs hidden from oversight. “A group of four related but separate unacknowledged SCI programs dating back to a 1947 Truman memorandum still exist and were housed as of the 1990s in major aerospace companies such as for example Lockheed, TRW, Raytheon, Aerospace Corp. etc. These would be expensive programs since the cost of secrecy can be several times bigger than the research… the black programs collectively have budgets in the $10B range annually. Topics apparently include both reverse engineering and extraterrestrial biology.”

Haisch states “the **AATIP** program did find the UFO crash retrieval program via official channels, but was denied access to it because the **AATIP** itself is not a SAP. Sen. Harry Reid petitioned the DoD to confer SAP status to the **AATIP**, but the DoD denied his request.”

Haisch also states: “It is easier to keep a program hidden in a contractor facility than in a government facility…a crash retrieval or some classified continuation of **Project Blue Book** would likely exist as a deep, black industrial-based SAP. A program involving hardware would be considered technology rather than intelligence and most likely fall under the office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (OUSDAT). Ironically, for such a program, even someone having an intelligence “ticket” at the highest level would not be considered to have a need to know. All of this results in very effective isolation and virtually no one in a position of open civilian governmental
authority, being cognizant of this after a time even though at least in principle of the Special Access Program oversight committee, SAPOC, should be cognizant of such a program. I do not know of any fundamentally limiting factors in the potential longevity of a program. The extreme compartmentalization and limited oversight would tend to keep a program in existence, perhaps indefinitely. Political leaders come and go, pandering to the masses for votes in the eyes of many within the military and intelligence communities, and as a result have varying degrees of respect and trust in that world. Deep Black programs can become quite independent of any given administration, and it would certainly be unrealistic to assume that a given president has been briefed on every SAP. A president does not automatically have a need to know. Moreover, Freedom Of Information Act requests cannot penetrate Unacknowledged Special Access Programs.”

He also claims the Tic Tac metamaterial came from “Earth humans” from the future and people from the future come back in time to create “past events” which in turns create a “Novikov loop” (a paradox where the origin of the event cannot be known). Sarfatti claims he is close to Bechtel, was close to the Reagan Administration and former SDI proponent and SecDef Caspar Weinberger, and states he received phone calls from a “mechanical voice” when he was young that put him into a hypnotic state where he was led to theorize about quantum vacuum energy and faster-than-light propulsion. Jacques Vallée states it was “undeniable” he was a child prodigy.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **29 April 2020** — Journalist Tim McMillan states a source who worked for **BAASS** and **AAWSAP** told him the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) had some UAP materials as early as 1947. He states it was transferred to Lockheed Martin in 1977 ahead of expected USG oversight in 1979. In response to the claim, Eric Davis states the **BAASS** source is “ill-informed” and not “in the know” about the history of legacy UAP recovery and reverse engineering. Davis states the claims of Lockheed receiving UAP information from the AEC in 1977 are false.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **10 July 2020** — U.S. Navy Capt. Joseph F. Gradisher, OPNAV N2N6 Public Affairs, admits in an email that he and Susan Gough of OSD Public Affairs seek to control FOIA replies from all USG agencies/departments related to UAP. “Generally speaking, we let the normal FOIA process work as it is supposed to…but we have been requesting that FOIA offices coordinate with us on
UAP-focused FOIA responses before they hit ‘reply’ so that new terms/language/etc. aren’t introduced that complicate the overall messaging efforts.”

Gradisher’s admission is of questionable legality considering federal government-wide FOIA responses are not supposed to be managed by the Navy to affect strategic messaging of an issue as it relates to the American public. The emails of admission were declassified through FOIA on 9 March 2021.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **19 July 2020** — Former **AATIP** director while he is at To The Stars Academy Lue Elizondo states on a public radio program that he was on the Hill, in a SCIF, meeting with several individuals about UAP. Elizondo states an “older gentleman” was sitting in the corner of the room and didn’t introduce himself and told him “Look, I had your job (with a particular service, I’m not going to mention what service it was)...I had your job back in the ‘80s.” Elizondo states this man was legitimate and the fact that he didn’t know who he was suggests there is “some sense of legacy” of the UAP issue where it was studied at high levels prior to **AATIP**, but after **Project Blue Book** unbeknownst to the public.

Elizondo states the man told him **AATIP** got further than the 1980s program, but didn’t clarify if that meant from a findings perspective, a budgetary perspective or a political perspective.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **24 July 2020** — A declassified briefing card utilized by the Navy’s Chief of Information and the Office of Information tells all personnel to “not refer to UAPs as UFOs. The latter term is intrinsically linked to the concept of extraterrestrials and the associated hysteria generated by the media that cover this topic.” It was prepared by Capt. Joseph F. Gradisher and OSD Public Affairs Susan Gough. The card suggests the Navy was attempting to avoid public discussion of the extraterrestrial hypothesis and had a strategic priority to avoid “hysteria.”

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **1 May 2021** — An anonymous “government insider” tells ufologist Joe Murgia that: “Various people within the United States government, in positions of oversight and who you would think had access to all UAP programs, did not find the UAP crash retrieval program when they looked because they never knew of its existence. I, and others in my circle, have discussed the topic with them of how one cannot find waived-unacknowledged SAPs that operate outside of Section 119 of Title 10. In fact, a DoD office can create a shell company and then transfer funds to it under an unremarkable commercial defense services contract. Then that shell company turns around and gives a subcontract to a third-party aerospace/defense firm that hosts a waived-unacknowledged SAP that operates outside of Sect. 119 of Title 10. This usually hides (making the audit trail terminate at the shell company) the flow of money going to the third party company that’s running a waived-unacknowledged SAP where a UAP crash retrieval program is hidden.”

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **25 June 2021** — The ODNI’s report to Congressional Intelligence and Armed Services Committees on progress made by the **Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force** (**UAPTF**) is published. The **UAPTF** discloses (p2) it received input from USD(I&S), DIA, FBI, NRO, NGA, NSA, Air Force, Army, Navy, Marine Corps, DARPA, FAA, NASA, NOAA, ODNI and presumably CIA, whose name is redacted.

Neither the Department of Energy (DOE) nor its agency the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) are mentioned as having contributed. This may be a meaningful omission, and may indicate classified aerospace programs or commercial aerospace programs linked to that agency, its offices, facilities or contractors were responsible for some of the 144 UAP cases analyzed.

In particular, one NNSA contractor, Triad National Security LLC based in Los Alamos, NM, filed a patent for aerospace vehicles that traveled inside self-generated “air-buoyant structures” made of low density aerogel or vapor-expanded material to achieve “buoyancy in air.” The patent was published two weeks before the **UAPTF** report was delivered to Congress and matches the description of at least one high-profile UAP case where a USN pilot told Lt. Ryan Graves he witnessed a “sphere encasing a cube” in 2014 over the Atlantic Ocean east of Virginia. The Triad National Security LLC patent states an
air-buoyant structure around a craft could be spherical, cylindrical, torus, pill or lattice shaped. Triad’s website states its primary client is the NNSA and it is comprised of three partners: Battelle Memorial Institute, The Texas A&M University System and the University of California.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **3 September 2021** — Australian journalist Ross Coulthart states on a podcast that U.S. Navy Dir. of Science and Technology Development Nat Kobitz told him “out of the blue” he was read into a UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering program. Kobitz told him “multiple” UAP were retrieved, Kobitz did not see them personally and he was told there was an active program to reverse engineer the technology.

Kobitz also tells Coulthart he was taken in a room at Wright-Patterson AFB after retirement and showed a light and strong metal that had different isotopic ratios from terrestrial metals. The Navy has been engaged in a UAP public messaging effort (see 24 July 2020) and accused by Rep. Mark Walker (see 6 September 2019) of withholding UAP information. It is possible that even though elements are sharing information with UAPTF, deeper black programs like Kobitz and former Dir. of Naval Intelligence Sumner Shapiro (see 16 March 2022) refer to and Navy collaboration with DOE on the UAP issue are not being disclosed to Congress.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **15 September 2021** — Ufologists inquire with anonymous intelligence community sources about “Mary Elizabeth Elliot,” mentioned in the alleged VADM Wilson memo as connected to a TRW situation and an attorney “Jeffrey W. Griffith.” Elliot knows something with respect to UAP and TRW that she will only share on her deathbed, they claim.

Jeffrey W. Griffith is the person ufologist Richard Dolan stated with “near certainty” was the author of the Sedge Masters/**Zodiac** crash recovery story, which Dolan also claimed was connected to TRW. Griffith’s biography shows he was the corporate counsel for Hughes Aircraft. Two co-founders of TRW (Ramo and Wooldridge) resigned from Hughes Aircraft in 1953 and eventually merged with Thompson Products to become TRW in 1965. Prior to the merger, Ramo-Wooldridge spun off Space Technology Laboratories (STL) into The Aerospace Corporation at the request of Congress in 1959.

This was allegedly discovered, told to the Truman Administration, and a small group of military (possibly Army) personnel retrieved the gold totalling $1.2 trillion at the time. Sheehan states it was put into a private trust and two partners from Brown Brothers Harriman became the trustees for the stolen gold.

Sheehan states when a flying saucer was discovered in New Mexico in 1947, it was brought to Wright Field and the “Anderson Trust” was established with trustees Robert Anderson, Robert Lovett and John Jay McCloy, all senior partners at Brown Brothers Harriman. Sheehan states a USG group, funded by the covert money from Brown Brothers Harriman, took custody of the UAP technology and “brought in major corporations” like Lockheed, Boeing, and others and “swore them to complete secrecy.” This group has since been allegedly trying to monopolize this technology and monopolize the information about the UAP occupants, etc. Sheehan states he does not know if the group has had diplomatic relations with the ET/UTs, but some witnesses he has spoken to tell him the group is engaging non-human entities.

Puthoff also states it is possible fundamental physics knowledge is being withheld from the broader scientific community. Puthoff states it would be the case “if we have mastered anti-gravity, and they’re being built by aerospace corporations;
the new physics would have to be involved.” Puthoff claims something “is missing” from Einstein’s General Relativity, and what is missing would have the effect of manipulating gravity.

It had been reported to me by not one but two sources that there've been deliberate attempts to cause injury to people who are working on the periphery of that program and there was concern that some of the people are not being adequately protected….there's a concern that basically scientists working in
essentially research related to ongoing antigravitics research are suffering harassment from overseas intelligence services."
“In Huntsville, Alabama, USA there’s a very black program underway that was previously run by a Chinese-American scientist called Ning Li…there is a very active anti-gravity program…I’m told there is equally an extraordinarily aggressive and nasty Chinese counterintelligence operation underway, to try to find out as much as possible through harassment and simple things like poison. There’s an espionage
battle underway as we speak.”

“D-Notice,” which prevents publication of sensitive materials in the UK. He cites a paragraph in a “UK Restricted” minute from the author of **Project Condign** Ron Haddow, which states: “The remaining ASTRA/AURORA photos and 35mm slides are also on this last file. There was a Press ‘D’ Notice issued at the time.”

>**_Note_**: This may be significant because it suggests the British MOD may have been in possession of photographic evidence of UAP it believed to be sourced from USG/USG contractor projects Aurora or Astra. Noted in 22 December 1992, British officials chose to monitor USAF communication that was concerned Secretary Donald B. Rice lied to Congress by stating Aurora didn’t exist. British interest in triangular UAP stems from several overflights of British airspace.

>**_Note_**: There is nothing in declassified MOD records that suggests the Ministry tracked efforts by then SSCI Staff Director Chris Mellon on behalf of Sen. Robert Byrd to investigate the existence of Aurora, or efforts by Byrd’s counsel Richard D’Amato (see 22 May 1992). Mellon stated on the record “there is no such \[secret U.S. triangular craft\] program,” while D’Amato stated he believed triangular UAP were human made. Neither specified if their comments included UAP sighted over British airspace.



**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **23 August 2022** — Anonymous site with possibly specific intelligence details on UAP in the PUBLIC DOMAIN posts an article on “NURO and the Unidentified Submersible Phenomena.” Much of the article is in a custom language only decipherable by custom software unknown to the PUBLIC DOMAIN, but what is public states that the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office (NURO) collects MASINT data on underwater UAP and seeks but is unable to coordinate with a group known as “SV17q.”

The article claims a database known as “DOLYN” collects signature data of underwater fast movers, tic-tac kinetic vehicles, orbs etc. to study the capabilities of those objects. The article states the data is “confiscated” by “SV17q” under the “no-right-to-known dictum.” It states the DOLYN database has 17,500 signatures including non-terrestrial signatures. It also states this information was not shared with the **UAPTF**.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **20 October 2022** — Ufologist Grant Cameron publishes a collection of people who claim to have piloted a UFO, many of whom never before spoke publicly. The trained observers mentioned include United Airlines Capt. Joe Vallejo who claims he had recurring dreams while on layovers where he was controlling a craft with his mind while standing in front of a large screen; ret.

USAF F-16 pilot “Col. David,” who claims he was in a room with a flat console along one wall where someone behind him told him he already knew how to fly the craft, and he began flying it mentally; and alleged Nellis AFB radar operator Niara Isley who claims she experienced a “neural interface” in a chair inside a saucer. In the book, ret. CIA analyst John Ramirez also states Tremelo Melchizedek was hired to attempt to use Merkabah meditation techniques to fly a craft in USG possession. Ramirez himself claims he travels mentally to an “icy planet” where he receives information from a “higher consciousness.”

The book additionally tracks Peter Whitley, an American who moved to Japan and trained in The Monroe Institute who held 40 out of body sessions where he was in a craft interacting with beings telepathically; ret. British Army officer Gerard Pratt who dreamt of going on board a large disc where he was given a briefing and shown how to use a plastic-like panel with symbols; Jean Kimura, who claims
while in Boynton Canyon near Sedona, AZ she and one friend had a shared dream in which they were invited by Saint Germain onto a craft with people that looked like humans; and Enrique Villanueva of Mission Rahma, who claims he used Merkabah meditation to go inside a “spaceship from a civilization supposedly from the future Earth.”

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **20 October 2022** — Grant Cameron chronicles a meeting between Ret. USAF Sgt. Jim Penniston, Rendlesham Forest incident witness, and Kit Green with his lawyer Pat Frascogna. Penniston states Green wanted DNA samples and an MRI from Penniston, and Green told him he was working for Bigelow Aerospace to understand how the technology “enables dimensional travel.”

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **20 October 2022** — Cameron also provides an audiotape of Green interviewing a woman “CRM” who was allegedly a psychic to understand UAP hotspots. CRM told Green about a “portal” related to a underwater UAP base near the Catalina Islands off the coast of Southern California, controlled by a group of extraterrestrials and humans, to which Green is surprised to hear.

A transcript of the conversation mentions there was a planned meeting between high ranking civilian and military personnel and “The Others,” “The Watchers,” and the “Extraterrestrials” to “give directions concerning geologic stabilization.” Human oil drilling catalyzed certain tectonic plate movements near the California coast. The council of those ET/UT species allegedly tasked with maintaining the stability of their Catalina “base.”

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **27 October 2022** — Real estate billionaire and owner of Skinwalker Ranch Brandon Fugal says Gen. Wesley Clark, Hal Puthoff and Kit Green convinced him there was “truth” to UAP reverse engineering concepts and free energy devices, and Fugal began supporting Joe Firmage’s work by co-founding Motion Sciences in the late 2000s.

Fugal says within a year the tests of antigravity devices did not show enough progress and their company closed down. Fugal says in 2015, Puthoff and Green again called him and suggested he buy Skinwalker from Bigelow, so he did.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **6 December 2022** — The associated UAP provisions of the final FY2023 National Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 7776) are published and there are two last minute changes of note. 1. A provision of the SSCI-approved bill to grant a private cause of action for persons who feel they’ve suffered reprisal has been dropped. 2. The AARO has been given responsibility for the historical study and the GAO is given the ability to perform a later “audit.”

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **17 December 2022** — USD(I&S) Ronald Moultrie and AARO Director Sean Kirkpatrick state they have not seen any evidence of crashed UAP that suggests the craft are from another planet or dimension. They state they have a lot of documents, memos, records, etc. and they tell the public in a press conference that to this point they have come across no “holdings” that there have been off-world crash recoveries.

**(PUBLIC DOMAIN)** - **17 December 2022** — A newly declassified calendar entry from former DCI Allen Dulles shows he met with President John F. Kennedy on 28 June 1961 at 12:00pm ET and 3:30pm ET. This may be significant because a disputed memo from JFK to Dulles on 28 June 1961 requests a review of “MJ-12” intelligence operation plans as they relate to Cold War psychological warfare plans.

A second disputed document allegedly created five months later on 5 November 1961 is an “operations review” of MJ-12 by Dulles, who references the JFK memo and also references that the operations are properly classified under the 1954 Atomic Energy Act.

A third disputed document also allegedly created that same date on 5 November 1961 is a Special National Intelligence Estimate on MJTWELVE operations prepared for the President’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board. The document mentions it is classified under the Atomic Energy Act and mentions six crash recoveries of “unidentified space vehicles” in which nuclear materials were claimed to be involved. Hal Puthoff states the 1961 SNIE is legitimate.
