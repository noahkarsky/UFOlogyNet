# anonymous_phenomena_timeline
 Work conducted to clean up and analyse the anonymous ufo timeline that came out of the July 26 Congressional hearings on the phenomena


The method to generate the graph is as follows:

1. Use custom function in 1_parsing to get data from the markdown file
2. Use Babelscape/rebel-large to extract the entities from the text that we pulled from each event
3. We needed to do some data cleaning and preparation in 3_cleaning_data
4. We then generate the graph.html

Original PDF I believe is anonymous, but I picked it up from [twitter](https://twitter.com/richgel999/status/1687005444676493312)


In terms of the data itself, I think it needs more tlc to be useful. Someday I will [fold it into my other knowledge graph](https://noahkarsky.github.io/project-amanita/), and hopefully will find the right tool to make the data more accessible.
